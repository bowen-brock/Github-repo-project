    "This project was designed to reinforce the web scraping and natural language processing skills taught at Codeup. The prompt for the project required us to: scrape a minimum of 100 readme files from Github, prepare the data, evaluate it using natural language processing techniques, and build a model that could successfully predict the repository's programming language. We chose to scrape approximately 490 repositories. After data cleaning and preparation, our total count left was 463 repositories. Before moving into exploration, we decided to further drop data languages that had less than 20 repositories. Finally we explored the data using NLP techniques and created three classification models. Please refer to the final notebook in this repository to see our final results! "
