  "readme_contents": "About appledoc\n==============\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTICE:** [collaborators needed](http://gentlebytes.com/blog/2015/11/02/appledoc-contributors-needed/)\n\nappledoc is command line tool that helps Objective-C developers generate Apple-like source code documentation from specially formatted source code comments. It's designed to take as readable source code comments as possible for the input and use comments as well as surrounding source code to generate visually appealing documentation in the form of HTML as well as fully indexed and browsable Xcode documentation set. Although there are several tools that can create HTML documentation for Objective-C, all of those known to me fall short in meeting the minimum of goals described below.\n\nMain goals of appledoc:\n\n- Human-readable source code comments.\n- Simple cross references to objects and members.\n- Generate Apple-like source code HTML documentation.\n- Generate and install fully indexed and browsable Xcode documentation set.\n- Single tool to drive generation from source code parsing to documentation set installation.\n- Easily customizable output.\n- 100% Objective-C implementation for easy debugging.\n\nTo make your experience with appledoc as smooth as possible, we warmly suggest reading this whole document as well as all online documentation mentioned in \"using appledoc\" section below!\n\nUsage of appledoc is allowed under the terms listed in LICENSE section at the bottom of this file!\n\nWant to keep updated? Follow us on Twitter - [@gentlebytes](http://twitter.com/gentlebytes).\n\n\nQuick install\n=============\n\nThe recommended way is to clone GitHub project and compile the tool from Xcode. As cloning GitHub project will create the link to the main repository, it greatly simplifies future upgrading too. To install, type the following in the Terminal:\n\n\tgit clone git://github.com/tomaz/appledoc.git\n\nThis creates appledoc directory. Within you can find appledoc.xcworkspace Xcode workspace; open it and compile appledoc target - this should work out of the box, however your system must meet minimum system requirements, see below. I recommend you copy resulting appledoc executable from build directory to one of the directories in your path (`echo $PATH`) to make it easily accessible.\n\nOptional:\nAppledoc is selfcontained and contains the necessary template files. IF you want to modify these default  from Templates subdirectory to one of the expected locations:\n\n- ~/Library/Application Support/appledoc\n- ~/.appledoc\n\nYou can also use install-appledoc.sh script to perform quick installation. Open Terminal and switch to appledoc directory. Type following command:\n\n\tsudo sh install-appledoc.sh (if you need templates add '-t default')\n\nIt compiles appledoc and installs its binary to /usr/local/bin and templates (if wanted) to ~/.appledoc by default. You can override this directories with -b and -t options respectively. For example:\n\n\tsudo sh install-appledoc.sh -b /usr/bin -t ~/Library/Application\\ Support/appledoc\n\t\n**Alternatively with Homebrew:**\n\n    brew install appledoc\n\nHomebrew does not install templates by default.\n\nUsing appledoc\n==============\n\nUse `appledoc --help` to see the list of all command line switches. Read more about appledoc on [appledoc site](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc). Also read [wiki pages](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc/wiki/index) for some more in-depth articles.\n\nUse [appledoc Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/appledoc) as a forum for questions on usage or other general questions.\n\nUse [appledoc issues page](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc/issues) to submit bug and feature requests. Before submitting new issues, check the forums to see if your question is answered there - unless you can confirm your issue as a new feature request or a bug, you should start at the forum to keep GitHub issues clean. Also read through issues to see if the issue is already there and vote on it or add a comment (don't forget about closed issues).\n\nInstallation tips\n-----------------\n\nTo keep up to date, just go to Terminal and cd into appledoc directory, issue `git pull` and recompile appledoc.xcodeproj. Don't forget to overwrite appledoc executable you've copied to $PATH :)\n\nIf you also want to compile and run AppledocTests (unit tests) target, you need to copy all the frameworks indicated within Libraries & Frameworks group to shared frameworks directory before building unit tests target! This is not required for building the appledoc tool itself.\n\nIntegrating with Xcode\n-----------------\n\nYou can setup Xcode to automate appledoc document creation. [Find out how](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc/blob/master/XcodeIntegrationScript.markdown) using a Run Script and your project's Build Phases.\n\nDocset usage tips\n-----------------\n\nPre-generated documentation and docsets for most Cocoa frameworks are available at:  \n- [CocoaDocs](http://cocoadocs.org)\n\nOnce you have a docset, you might want to use it with a documentation browser:  \n- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)  \n- [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash)\n\nTroubleshooting\n---------------\n\nHave problems? This is what you can do to troubleshoot:\n\n1. Make sure you have the latest appledoc version. Try `git pull` and run with latest version again.\n2. IF you have template files installed, make sure you're using the latest - delete the predefined folders and have appledoc copy the files from its embedded archive again (see Quick Install section above).\n3. Increase verbosity level with `--verbose` command line switch. Default level is 2, but you can progressively increment verbosity up to 6 with each level giving you more detailed information. As this will give you a lot more information, you may want to concentrate only on specific set of source files you have problem with. Note that increasing verbosity will result in slower performance so using levels above 4 for every day use is not recommended.\n4. Appledoc is open source project! You have all the source code available, so run it from Xcode. You can setup Xcode to pass the desired command line arguments and add breakpoints to help you isolate your issue. If you feel you'd like to contribute more to community, you are welcome to fork the project on GitHub and add features to it. Keep us posted so we can add these features to main repository as well - include unit tests if possible.\n5. If you think you found a bug or want to request new feature, go to [appledoc issues page](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc/issues). First read existing issues to see if there is already a request there (if you're using master branch, also read closed issues as your request may have already been covered but isn't yet merged on master branch). You can vote on existing requests to help us decide which features to concentrate on or you can add a comment to aid in solving it. If you don't find the request there, create a new issue; include parts of source files that give you problems if possible and/or description or steps that lead to it.\n6. If you're having problems with some of your source files and don't want to publish them online, you can contact us through email below. We'll do our best to help you out, but bear in mind appledoc is not commercial product; it's created and maintained in our spare time, so resources are limited.\n\n\nDeveloper notes\n---------------\n\nIf you wish to contribute, see the [Developer Notes file](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc/blob/master/Developer%20Notes.markdown) for short overview of how appledoc works internally.\n\n\nMinimum system requirements\n---------------------------\n\n- Xcode 4.5 or greater for compiling\n- OS X 10.7 for compiling and running\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nappledoc is licensed with modified BSD license.

In this sample, we render in 2 passes. As such it is also an example of a multipass renderer in Metal. A \"pass\" in this case is defined as all draws to a texture before swapping it out for a new texture. The first pass renders a shadow map based on the calculated position of a sun. The second pass performs a deferred lighting algorithm by writing to and reading from a framebuffer containing 4 color attachments. Three of the attachments are seeded with the g-buffer values (albedo, linear depth, normal). Next, light primitives are rendered to accumulate light into the light accumulation attachment, reading the g-buffer values directly from the other attachments. A full screen quad combines the light accumulation buffer with the albedo texture, samples the shadow map as a texture, and applies the light contribution from the sun. The results of this composition pass overwrites the albedo attachment with the final composited output. Lastly, particles representing each point light (lovingly called fairies) are rendered on top. What began as the albedo texture in the g-buffer now contains the final value, which can be presented to the display as its texture is the CAMetalLayer's drawable texture.</sup> |\n| [<sup>MetalImageProcessing</sup>](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/MetalImageProcessing/Introduction/Intro.html) | <sup>Graphics & Animation</sup><br/><sup>(3D Drawing)</sup> | <sup>Metal</sup> | <sup>This sample shows how to load a texture into a 2D Quad and perform a simple grayscale conversion compute post processing pass using Metal.</sup> |\n| [<sup>MetalInstancedHelix</sup>](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/MetalInstancedHelix/Introduction/Intro.html) | <sup></sup> | <sup>Metal</sup> | <sup>This example renders a set of cubes using Metal and alternates their colors by modifying each cube's uniforms directly in the shared CPU/GPU memory buffer.

Each cube is renderered individually using a basic 3D phong lighting shader, but drawn in only a single draw call using Metal's instancing API. Note, for each frame, each cube's transformation matrix is update along with its color, therefore in each frame the sample must traverese through 2n cubes.</sup> |\n| [<sup>MetalKitEssentials: Using the MetalKit View, Texture Loader, and Model I/O</sup>](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/MetalKitEssentials/Introduction/Intro.html) | <sup>Graphics & Animation</sup><br/><sup>(3D Drawing)</sup> | <sup>MetalKit</sup> | <sup>This sample demonstrates how to use key functionality provided by MetalKit on both iOS and OS X, including usage of the MetalKit view, texture loader, and the Model I/O integration.

This script allows automated Apple ID creation\nfrom a spreadsheet. Apple IDs are created without a credit card, which\nis great for many deployments. There is a \u201cdry run\u201d feature to test the\nscript without actually creating the Apple ID.\n\n### Requirements\n\n-   **IMPORTANT**: Apple uses a velocity check to prevent too many Apple\n    IDs from a single IP address. You must contact your Apple business\n    representative to request that your IP address is whitelisted for a\n    short time.\n-   Being [AppleScript][], this runs only on Macs.\n-   [iTunes 11.2.2][] is currently required. Future versions may break the\n    script.\n-   [UI Scripting][] allows us to script otherwise non-scriptbale\n    interfaces. Turn this on in System Preferences \\> Accessibility and\n    check \u201cEnable access for assistive devices.\u201d\n-   Apple has [strong password requirements][]. Account creation will\n    fail if the passwords are too weak.\n\n### Instructions\n\nA template CSV file is included. Create csv file. Then run the script.\n\n\n#### CSV file tips\n\n* keep the column headers,\n* fill out all columns, \n* use comma as a column separator,\n* don't leave empty lines,\n* use MS Excel or Numbers to create file,\n* don't include the \"- \" in front of the security questions,\n* leave last column blank,\n* for the state just use the two letter initial, ie \"NY\" not \"NY - New York\" as its listed in iTunes,\n* for the month in birth date use month names with capital first letter, ie \"January\" for january,\n\n\n### Security Questions\n\nAs of iTunes 10.6.1 Apple has required three security questions. The\nBatch Apple ID Creator allows you to choose the questions from the list\nbelow. Each question should be copied into the appropriate spreadsheet\ncolumn (Security Question 1, 2 or 3) exactly as typed below.\n\n#### Security Question 1\n\n-   What is the first name of your best friend in high school?\n-   What was the name of your first pet?\n-   What was the first thing you learned to cook?\n-   What was the first film you saw in the theater?\n-   Where did you go the first time you flew on a plane?\n-   What is the last name of your favorite elementary school teacher?\n\n#### Security Question 2\n\n-   What is your dream job?\n-   What is your favorite children's book?\n-   What was the model of your first car?\n-   What was your childhood nickname?\n-   Who was your favorite film star or character in school?\n-   Who was your favorite singer or band in high school?\n\n#### Security Question 3\n\n-   In what city did your parents meet?\n-   What was the first name of your first boss?\n-   What is the name of the street where you grew up?\n-   What is the name of the first beach you visited?\n-   What was the first album that you purchased?\n-   What is the name of your favorite sports team?\n\n### Known Bugs\n\nErrors are not handled gracefully. Although some errors are recoverable,\nif the script stops, it loses track of its progress. Edit the\nspreadsheet to continue.\n\nAt the end of this script, Apple will send a verification email to the\nApple ID. To complete verification, click the link in the message, then\nre-enter the account address and password.\n\n### Download\n\nThe files are downloadable from GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/brandonusher/Apple-ID-AppleScript Feel free to fork\nand improve.\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nThis script was originally created by Enterprise iOS user [Greg\nMoore][], who works for Hope Public Schools in Hope, Arkansas. [Aaron\nFreimark][] then updated the script to work with iTunes 10.6.1 and the\nmultiple recovery questions. Discuss on [EnterpriseiOS.com][]. This\nscript or derivatives must not be sold. If you make it better, please\ngive back to the community that brought it to you.\n\nThe base for this script was created by [Aaron Freimark][1]\n\nUpdated version brought to you by [Brandon Usher][]\n\n  [AppleScript]: http://developer.apple.com/applescript/\n  [iTunes 11.2.2]: http://www.apple.com/itunes/\n  [UI Scripting]: http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.21/21.06/UserInterfaceScripting/index.html\n  [strong password requirements]: http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1728\n  [Greg Moore]: http://www.enterpriseios.com/users/Eight_Quarter_Bit\n  [Aaron Freimark]: http://www.enterpriseios.com/users/Aaron_Freimark\n  [EnterpriseiOS.com]: http://www.enterpriseios.com/wiki/Batch_Apple_ID_Generator\n  [1]: https://github.com/aaronfreimark/Apple-ID-AppleScript\n  [Brandon Usher]: https://github.com/brandonusher\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Prince of Persia Apple II\n\nSome background: This archive contains the source code for the original Prince of Persia game that I wrote on the Apple II, in 6502 assembly language, between 1985-89. The game was first released by Broderbund Software in 1989, and is part of the ongoing Ubisoft game franchise.\n\nFor a capsule summary of Prince of Persia's 25-year history, and my involvement with its various incarnations, see [jordanmechner.com](https://jordanmechner.com/).\n\nFor those interested in a fuller understanding of the context -- creative, business, personal, and technical -- in which this source code was created, I've published my dev journals from that period. See [jordanmechner.com/books/journals](https://jordanmechner.com/books/journals).\n\nFor those who'd like to dig into the source code itself, I've posted an explanatory technical document at [jordanmechner.com/library](https://jordanmechner.com/library) which should help. This is a package I put together in October 1989 for the benefit of the teams that were undertaking the ports of POP to various platforms such as PC, Amiga, Sega, Genesis, etc.\n\nBeyond that, please don't ask me to explain anything about the source code, because I don't remember! I hung up my 6502 programming guns in October 1989, and after two decades working primarily as a writer, game designer, and creative director, to say my coding skills are rusty would be an understatement.\n\nThanks to [Jason Scott](http://www.textfiles.com) and [Tony Diaz](http://www.apple2.org) for successfully extracting the source code from a 22-year-old 3.5\" floppy disk archive, a task that took most of a long day and night, and would have taken much longer if not for Tony's incredible expertise, perseverence, and well-maintained collection of vintage Apple hardware.\n\nWe extracted and posted the 6502 code because it was a piece of computer history that could be of interest to others, and because if we hadn't, it might have been lost for all time. We did this for fun, not profit. As the author and copyright holder of this source code, I personally have no problem with anyone studying it, modifying it, attempting to run it, etc. Please understand that this does NOT constitute a grant of rights of any kind in Prince of Persia, which is an ongoing Ubisoft game franchise. Ubisoft alone has the right to make and distribute Prince of Persia games.\n\nThat's about all I know. If additional information becomes available, I'll post and/or tweet about it ([@jmechner](https://twitter.com/jmechner)). In the meantime, if you have questions -- technical, legal, or otherwise -- I recommend that you direct them to the community at large, whose collective knowledge and expertise far exceeds mine, and will only increase as more people get their eyes on this code.\n\nAs for me, it's time to get back to my day job of making new games and making up stories.\n\nHave fun!\n\n-- Jordan Mechner\n"

  "readme_contents": "\n  Apple Hardware Test (AHT)\n=============================\n\n Description\n-------------\n\nApple computers ship with a pre-installed suite of hardware diagnostic tools, known as Apple Hardware Test (AHT). In principle you can start them by holding the `d` key while booting. Newer models support holding `option d` to load AHT over the internet. Refer to the official Apple documentation for details: Using AHT on [Intel-based Macs](https://support.apple.com/kb/ht1509), [Mountain Lion](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH11342), [Mavericks](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH14291) and [Yosemite](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18765). Apple redesigned the AHT, now called [Apple Diagnostics](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT5781), for Macs introduced after June 2013. Consult the [reference codes](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203747) to interpret the results.\n\nIf however, you reinstalled an older computer from scratch, the diagnostic tools might no longer be available. Unless you have the original disks that came with your computer, there seems to be no way to restore the AHT.\n\nIt happens that Apple provides disk images with AHT for most computers, but does not make the links publicly available. Various blogs and forums, mostly [Riven by Five](https://rivenbyfive.blogspot.ch/2012/01/download-and-run-apple-hardware-test.html) and [MacForum.ro](http://arhiva.macforum.ro/comunitate/topic/1194-apple-hardware-test/) have gathered a list of download links. The rest were obtained by scraping `https://download.info.apple.com/Apple_Hardware_Test/` for all the links of the form `0(18|22)-\\d{4}-A.dmg`.\n\nEven though there's no guarantee that this list is correct or complete, some links can come in very handy to whoever is trying to debug hardware problems.\n\nYou can use the following terminal commands to determine the model and board ID of your computer:\n\n```sh\nsysctl hw.model | awk '{ print $2 }'\nioreg -l | awk -F\\\" '/board-id/ { print $4 }'\n```\n\nDownload the AHT for your computer model and use the contents to restore the `/System/Library/CoreServices/.diagnostics` folder, then reboot while holding `d` to start the diagnostic tools. Alternatively you may try with a bootable USB stick, as described below. This is also the preferred way on OS X 10.11 or later, where the System Integrity Protection (SIP) no longer allows writing to system folders.\n\nWhen trying to open an old dmg you may get the error 'legacy image should be converted'. To convert it to a newer format, open Disk Utility, in the menu _Images_ click on _Convert_ and select the dmg to convert and save it under a new name.\n\nNote that there is no one-to-one correspondence between hardware model and AHT. For some models no hardware test could be found, while others seem to have multiple AHT. As the differences are not clear, feel free to try them out, to see which one works best for your hardware.\n\n Run AHT from bootable USB stick\n---------------------------------\n\n  * You need a bootable USB stick, for instance using Disk Utility's _Erase_ with `Format: OS X Extended` and `Scheme: GUID Partition Map`. On newer Macs you will need to do this using the command line. Make sure you replace `disk2` with the appropriate disk name. You can find out yours by running `diskutil list`.\n\n```sh\ndiskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ USBstick GPT disk2\n```\n\n  * Let's assume the USB stick is mounted under `/Volumes/USBstick`.\n  * Download the AHT for your computer model from the list below.\n  * Mount the AHT dmg. Let's refer to the mount point as `/Volumes/AHT`.\n  * Copy the AHT to the USB stick and flag it as bootable\n\n```sh\ncp -r /Volumes/AHT/System /Volumes/USBstick/\nsudo bless --folder /Volumes/USBstick/ --file /Volumes/USBstick/System/Library/CoreServices/.diagnostics/diags.efi --label AHT\n```\n\n  * Insert USB stick in the computer to be tested, boot holding the option key and select the AHT.\n\n\n Download Links\n----------------\n\n### PowerMac\n\n* [PowerMac v1.2.6, PowerMac G4](https://download.info.apple.com/Apple_Hardware_Test/693-3994-A.dmg)\n* [PowerMac

  "readme_contents": "# AppleNeuralHash2ONNX\n\nConvert Apple NeuralHash model for [CSAM Detection](https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/CSAM_Detection_Technical_Summary.pdf) to [ONNX](https://github.com/onnx/onnx).\n\n## Intro\n\nApple NeuralHash is a [perceptual hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_hashing) method for images based on neural networks. It can tolerate image resize and compression. The steps of hashing is as the following:\n1. Convert image to RGB.\n2. Resize image to `360x360`.\n3. Normalize RGB values to `[-1, 1]` range.\n4. Perform inference on the NeuralHash model.\n5. Calculate dot product of a `96x128` matrix with the resulting vector of 128 floats.\n6. Apply [binary step](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function) to the resulting 96 float vector.\n7. Convert the vector of 1.0 and 0.0 to bits, resulting in 96-bit binary data.\n\nIn this project, we convert Apple's NeuralHash model to ONNX format. A demo script for testing the model is also included.\n\n## Prerequisite\n\n### OS\n\nBoth macOS and Linux will work. In the following sections Debian is used for Linux example.\n\n### LZFSE decoder\n\n- macOS: Install by running `brew install lzfse`.\n- Linux: Build and install from [lzfse](https://github.com/lzfse/lzfse) source.\n\n### Python\n\nPython 3.6 and above should work. Install the following dependencies:\n```bash\npip install onnx coremltools\n```\n\n## Conversion Guide\n\n### Step 1: Get NeuralHash model\n\nYou will need 4 files from a recent macOS or iOS build:\n- neuralhash_128x96_seed1.dat\n- NeuralHashv3b-current.espresso.net\n- NeuralHashv3b-current.espresso.shape\n- NeuralHashv3b-current.espresso.weights\n\n**Option 1: From macOS or jailbroken iOS device (Recommended)**\n\nIf you have a recent version of macOS (11.4+) or jailbroken iOS (14.7+) installed, simply grab these files from `/System/Library/Frameworks/Vision.framework/Resources/` (on macOS) or `/System/Library/Frameworks/Vision.framework/` (on iOS).\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Option 2: From iOS IPSW (click to reveal)</summary>\n\n1. Download any `.ipsw` of a recent iOS build (14.7+) from [ipsw.me](https://ipsw.me/).\n2. Unpack the file:\n```bash\ncd /path/to/ipsw/file\nmkdir unpacked_ipsw\ncd unpacked_ipsw\nunzip ../*.ipsw\n```\n3. Locate system image:\n```bash\nls -lh\n```\nWhat you need is the largest `.dmg` file, for example `018-63036-003.dmg`.\n\n4. Mount system image. On macOS simply open the file in Finder. On Linux run the following commands:\n```bash\n# Build and install apfs-fuse\nsudo apt install fuse libfuse3-dev bzip2 libbz2-dev cmake g++ git libattr1-dev zlib1g-dev\ngit clone https://github.com/sgan81/apfs-fuse.git\ncd apfs-fuse\ngit submodule init\ngit submodule update\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\nmake\nsudo make install\nsudo ln -s /bin/fusermount /bin/fusermount3\n# Mount image\nmkdir rootfs\napfs-fuse 018-63036-003.dmg rootfs\n```\nRequired files are under `/System/Library/Frameworks/Vision.framework/` in mounted path.\n\n</details>\n\nPut them under the same directory:\n```bash\nmkdir NeuralHash\ncd NeuralHash\ncp /System/Library/Frameworks/Vision.framework/Resources/NeuralHashv3b-current.espresso.* .\ncp /System/Library/Frameworks/Vision.framework/Resources/neuralhash_128x96_seed1.dat .\n```\n\n### Step 2: Decode model structure and shapes\n\nNormally compiled Core ML models store structure in `model.espresso.net` and shapes in `model.espresso.shape`, both in JSON. It's the same for NeuralHash model but compressed with [LZFSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZFSE).\n\n```bash\ndd if=NeuralHashv3b-current.espresso.net bs=4 skip=7 | lzfse -decode -o model.espresso.net\ndd if=NeuralHashv3b-current.espresso.shape bs=4 skip=7 | lzfse -decode -o model.espresso.shape\ncp NeuralHashv3b-current.espresso.weights model.espresso.weights\n```\n\n### Step 3: Convert model to ONNX\n\n```bash\ncd ..\ngit clone https://github.com/AsuharietYgvar/TNN.git\ncd TNN\npython3 tools/onnx2tnn/onnx-coreml/coreml2onnx.py ../NeuralHash\n```\n\nThe resulting model is `NeuralHash/model.onnx`.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Inspect model\n\n[Netron](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron) is a perfect tool for this purpose.\n\n### Calculate neural hash with [onnxruntime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime)\n\n1. Install required libraries:\n```bash\npip install onnxruntime pillow\n```\n2. Run `nnhash.py` on an image:\n```bash\npython3 nnhash.py /path/to/model.onnx /path/to/neuralhash_128x96_seed1.dat image.jpg\n```\n\nExample output:\n```\nab14febaa837b6c1484c35e6\n```\n\n**Note:** Neural hash generated here might be a few bits off from one generated on an iOS device. This is expected since different iOS devices generate slightly different hashes anyway. The reason is that neural networks are based on floating-point calculations. The accuracy is highly dependent on the hardware. For smaller networks it won't make any difference. But NeuralHash has 200+ layers, resulting in significant cumulative errors.\n\n|Device|Hash|\n|---|---|\n|iPad Pro 10.5-inch|`2b186faa6b36ffcc4c4635e1`|\n|M1 Mac|`2b5c6faa6bb7bdcc4c4731a1`|\n|iOS Simulator|`2b5c6faa6bb6bdcc4c4731a1`|\n|ONNX Runtime|`2b5c6faa6bb6bdcc4c4735a1`|\n\n## Credits\n\n- [nhcalc](https://github.com/KhaosT/nhcalc) for uncovering NeuralHash private API.\n- [TNN](https://github.com/Tencent/TNN) for compiled Core ML to ONNX script.\n"

CUPS uses the Internet\nPrinting Protocol (\"IPP\") and provides System V and Berkeley command-line\ninterfaces, a web interface, and a C API to manage printers and print jobs.  It\nsupports printing to both local (parallel, serial, USB) and networked printers,\nand printers can be shared from one computer to another, even over the Internet!\n\nInternally, CUPS uses PostScript Printer Description (\"PPD\") files to describe\nprinter capabilities and features and a wide variety of generic and device-\nspecific programs to convert and print many types of files.  Sample drivers are\nincluded with CUPS to support many Dymo, EPSON, HP, Intellitech, OKIDATA, and\nZebra printers.  Many more drivers are available online and (in some cases) on\nthe driver CD-ROM that came with your printer.\n\nCUPS is licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0.  See the file\n\"LICENSE\" for more information.\n\n\nREADING THE DOCUMENTATION\n-------------------------\n\nInitial documentation to get you started is provided in the root directory of\nthe CUPS sources:\n\n- `CHANGES.md`: A list of changes in the current major release of CUPS.\n- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Guidelines for contributing to the CUPS project.\n- `CREDITS.md`: A list of past contributors to the CUPS project.\n- `DEVELOPING.md`: Guidelines for developing code for the CUPS project.\n- `INSTALL.md`: Instructions for building and installing CUPS.\n- `LICENSE`: The CUPS license agreement (Apache 2.0).\n- `NOTICE`: Copyright notices and exceptions to the CUPS license agreement.\n- `README.md`: This file.\n\nOnce you have installed the software you can access the documentation (and a\nbunch of other stuff) online at <http://localhost:631/> and using the `man`\ncommand, for example `man cups`.\n\nIf you're having trouble getting that far, the documentation is located under\nthe `doc/help` and `man` directories.\n\nPlease read the documentation before asking questions.\n\n\nGETTING SUPPORT AND OTHER RESOURCES\n-----------------------------------\n\nIf you have problems, *read the documentation first!*  We also provide two\nmailing lists which are available at <https://lists.cups.org/mailman/listinfo>.\n\nSee the CUPS web site at <https://www.cups.org/> for other resources.\n\n\nSETTING UP PRINTER QUEUES USING YOUR WEB BROWSER\n------------------------------------------------\n\nCUPS includes a web-based administration tool that allows you to manage\nprinters, classes, and jobs on your server.  Open <http://localhost:631/admin/>\nin your browser to access the printer administration tools:\n\n*Do not* use the hostname for your machine - it will not work with the default\nCUPS configuration.  To enable administration access on other addresses, check\nthe `Allow Remote Administration` box and click on the `Change Settings` button.\n\nYou will be asked for the administration password (root or any other user in the\n\"sys\", \"system\", \"root\", \"admin\", or \"lpadmin\" group on your system) when\nperforming any administrative function.\n\n\nSETTING UP PRINTER QUEUES FROM THE COMMAND-LINE\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nCUPS currently uses PPD (PostScript Printer Description) files that describe\nprinter capabilities and driver programs needed for each printer.  The\n`everywhere` PPD is used for nearly all modern networks printers sold since\nabout 2009.  For example, the following command creates a print queue for a\nprinter at address \"11.22.33.44\":\n\n    lpadmin -p printername -E -v ipp://11.22.33.44/ipp/print -m everywhere\n\nCUPS also includes several sample PPD files you can use for \"legacy\" printers:\n\n   Driver                         | PPD Name\n   -----------------------------  | ------------------------------\n   Dymo Label Printers            | drv:///sample.drv/dymo.ppd\n   Intellitech Intellibar         | drv:///sample.drv/intelbar.ppd\n   EPSON 9-pin Series             | drv:///sample.drv/epson9.ppd\n   EPSON 24-pin Series            | drv:///sample.drv/epson24.ppd\n   Generic PCL Laser Printer      | drv:///sample.drv/generpcl.ppd\n   Generic PostScript Printer     | drv:///sample.drv/generic.ppd\n   HP DeskJet Series              | drv:///sample.drv/deskjet.ppd\n   HP LaserJet Series             | drv:///sample.drv/laserjet.ppd\n   OKIDATA 9-Pin Series           | drv:///sample.drv/okidata9.ppd\n   OKIDATA 24-Pin Series          | drv:///sample.drv/okidat24.ppd\n   Zebra CPCL Label Printer       | drv:///sample.drv/zebracpl.ppd\n   Zebra EPL1 Label Printer       | drv:///sample.drv/zebraep1.ppd\n   Zebra EPL2 Label Printer       | drv:///sample.drv/zebraep2.ppd\n   Zebra ZPL Label Printer        | drv:///sample.drv/zebra.ppd\n\nYou can run the `lpinfo -m` command to list all of the available drivers:\n\n    lpinfo -m\n\nRun the `lpinfo -v` command to list the available printers:\n\n    lpinfo -v\n\nThen use the correct URI to add the printer using the `lpadmin` command:\n\n    lpadmin -p printername -E -v device-uri -m ppd-name\n\nCurrent network printers typically use `ipp` or `ipps` URIS:\n\n    lpadmin -p printername -E -v ipp://11.22.33.44/ipp/print -m everywhere\n    lpadmin -p printername -E -v ipps://11.22.33.44/ipp/print -m everywhere\n\nOlder network printers typically use `socket` or `lpd` URIs:\n\n    lpadmin -p printername -E -v socket://11.22.33.44 -m ppd-name\n    lpadmin -p printername -E -v lpd://11.22.33.44/ -m ppd-name\n\nThe sample drivers provide basic printing capabilities, but generally do not\nexercise the full potential of the printers or CUPS.  Other drivers provide\ngreater printing capabilities.\n\n\nPRINTING FILES\n--------------\n\nCUPS provides both the System V `lp` and Berkeley `lpr` commands for printing:\n\n    lp filename\n    lpr filename\n\nBoth the `lp` and `lpr` commands support printing options for the driver:\n\n    lp -o media=A4 -o resolution=600dpi filename\n    lpr -o media=A4 -o resolution=600dpi filename\n\nCUPS recognizes many types of images files as well as PDF, PostScript, and text\nfiles, so you can print those files directly rather than through an application.\n\nIf you have an application that generates output specifically for your printer\nthen you need to use the `-oraw` or `-l` options:\n\n    lp -o raw filename\n    lpr -l filename\n\nThis will prevent the filters from misinterpreting your print file.\n\n\nLEGAL STUFF\n-----------\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2007-2021 by Apple Inc.\nCopyright \u00a9 1997-2007 by Easy Software Products.\n\nCUPS is provided under the terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0 with\nexceptions for GPL2/LGPL2 software.

Generating an Apple Developer Token (JWT):\n\nMusish uses the Apple Music API and therefore you'll need a signed developer token from Apple.\n\nPlease reference [Apple's official guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi/getting_keys_and_creating_tokens) on generating the keys and an associated token.\n\n##### 2. Environment setup:\n\nMusish requires two environment variables to start. You'll need to enter your Apple Developer token as `APPLE_TOKEN`, and a link to your hosted Musish backend with `BACKEND_URL`.\n\n.env.example:\n\n```txt\nAPPLE_TOKEN=your_apple_music_token\nBACKEND_URL=https://musish.app\n```\n\n##### 3. Install dependencies:\n\n```shell\nyarn\n```\n\n##### 4. Launch Musish:\n\nStart webpack dev server on port 8080:\n\n```shell\nyarn start\n```\n\n_Or:_\n\n```shell\nyarn build\n```\n\nThis will create a directory called `dist` in the project root, these files can be served from a web server as static content.\n\n#### Running the Musish backend:\n\nWe use [Serverless](https://serverless.com) to run our backend on AWS lambdas, however you can choose differently here.\n\n##### Generating a Genius Developer Token:\n\nIf you wish to work on the Musish project's serverless backend, you will require a Genius Developer token.\n\nCreate a client access token via [Genius' developer portal](https://genius.com/developers).\n\n## Is it safe?\n\nMusish uses official Apple public APIs and libraries to handle authentication. The user is prompted to login directly on a new window under the Apple.com domain. Apple.com returns the user a temporary valid token to allow their browser to make requests to Apple Music data only.\n\nAt no point do we request, log, or gain access to information from a user of the site. The user's token is never sent to any server other than Apple's own. At no point do we ever intentionally pass any user information to any server which we control.\n\nOur official build (https://musi.sh/) is powered by Github Pages with an AWS lambda providing both lyrics and artist information, we send no cookies or headers related to your Apple account.\n\n---\n\nCredits:\n\n- Musish logo (headphone icon) provided by zidney from the Noun Project.\n"

Work is currently happening on the \"Porting\" branch, but only a small subset of the code even compiles right now.\n\nLong story short, __this driver does not yet actually connect to wireless networks__.\n\nIf you're interested in helping, it would be great to have more people try test builds just to ensure it accurately identifies all the hardware I don't have on hand to try.\n\n## Development Status\n\nThere are notes on [the project wiki](https://github.com/ammulder/AppleIntelWiFiMVM/wiki).  If you're interested in helping out at the code level, that would be super.\n\nRight now all the action is on the \"Porting\" branch.\n\n## Loading/Installation\nTypical third-party driver kexts should be installed to /Library/Extensions, but that's not recommended for this driver yet.  Even in this initial work I've managed to craft a bug that crashed my machine when the driver loaded.  If the driver was installed system-wide, that would happen on every boot, which seems rather unfortunate.  So the manual loading process is recommended for now.\n\n#### Manual Testing\n1. Download the latest AppleIntelWiFiMVM.kext.zip (or build from source)\n2. Unzip if needed\n3. From Terminal, go to where the kext is and run:\n```Shell\nchown -R root:wheel AppleIntelWiFiMVM.kext\nsudo kextload AppleIntelWiFiMVM.kext\nsudo kextunload AppleIntelWiFiMVM.kext\n```\n4. Run Console.app and scroll to the bottom of the system log (usually displayed by default) or search it for AppleIntelWiFiMVM.  You should see output such as:\n```Text\n2/12/16 11:16:51.000 PM kernel[0]: AppleIntelWiFiMVM loading for device Intel(R) Dual Band Wireless AC 7265\n2/12/16 11:16:51.000 PM kernel[0]: AppleIntelWiFiMVM LOADED firmware file iwlwifi-8000C-16.ucode\n```\n\n#### System-wide Installation\nYou've been warned!\n\nBut to install system-wide, use your favorite kext installer tool to install the kext to /Library/Extensions.  It should load automatically, and generate the same output as above that you can view in Console.app\n\n## Credits\n\nIn building this driver, I'm relying on:\n* The iwlwifi Linux driver\n* The Intel firmware releases for this hardware (probably largely due to the Linux drivers)\n* Mieze's IntelMausiEthernet OS X driver for wired Ethernet adapters\n* RehabMan and the-darkvoid's BrcmPatchRAM OS X driver for USB Bluetooth adapters\n\n## License\n\nThis driver (including any code I used in it from the projects above) is covered by the [GPL v2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html)\n\nThe Intel firmware is covered by the [firmware license](http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git;a=blob_plain;f=LICENCE.iwlwifi_firmware;hb=HEAD)\n"

See [details](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=uzyxiriy) in their announcement.\n\nIt is recommended to use [Pushy](https://github.com/jchambers/pushy) instead, which supports Apple's HTTP/2-based APNs protocol.\n\nBuild status:\n\n   * Main fork [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/notnoop/java-apns.png)](https://travis-ci.org/notnoop/java-apns)\n   * Development [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/java-apns/java-apns.png)](https://travis-ci.org/java-apns/java-apns)\n\nDevelopment - Version 1.0.0\n---------------------------\nThere currently is a perelease for 1.0.0 which fixes a number of problems over 0.2.3. \nThere's still a CI test that sporadically fails on Travis-CI only, but not on other test\nmachines I have access to. Supposedly it is a still undetected race condition.\n\nHowever 1.0.0 Beta fixes a *lot* of problems over 0.2.x, so even as it is called beta\nI'd recommend to use the beta instead of the 0.2.3 even for production.\n\nfroh42 will return to develop for java-apns in October, so I expect the 1.0.0 final\nto be released start of November.\n\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\njava-apns is a Java client for Apple Push Notification service (APNs).\nThe library aims to provide a highly scalable interface to the Apple\nserver, while still being simple and modular.\n\nThe interface aims to require very minimal code to achieve the most common\ncases, but have it be reconfigurable so you can even use your own networking\nconnections or JSON library if necessary.\n\nLinks: [Installation](http://wiki.github.com/notnoop/java-apns/installation)\n- [Javadocs](http://notnoop.github.com/java-apns/apidocs/index.html)\n- [Changelog](CHANGELOG)\n\nFeatures:\n--------------\n  *  Easy to use, high performance APNS Service API\n  *  Supports Apple Feedback service\n  *  Support Enhanced Apple Push Notification\n  *  Support MDM and Newsstand Notifications\n  *  Easy to use with Apple certificates\n  *  Easy to extend and reuse\n  *  Easy to integrate with dependency injection frameworks\n  *  Easy to setup custom notification payloads\n  *  Supports connection pooling\n  *  Supports re-transmission of Notifications after error\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\nAdd the following dependencies to your `pom.xml` file:\n\n\n        <dependency>\n             <groupId>com.notnoop.apns</groupId>\n             <artifactId>apns</artifactId>\n             <version>1.0.0.Beta6</version>\n        </dependency>\n\nSample Code\n-----------\n\nTo send a notification, you can do it in three steps:\n\n1. Setup the connection\n\n        ApnsService service =\n            APNS.newService()\n            .withCert(\"/path/to/certificate.p12\", \"MyCertPassword\")\n            .withSandboxDestination()\n            .build();\n\n2. Create and send the message\n\n        String payload = APNS.newPayload().alertBody(\"Can't be simpler than this!\").build();\n        String token = \"fedfbcfb....\";\n        service.push(token, payload);\n\n3. To query the feedback service for inactive devices:\n\n        Map<String, Date> inactiveDevices = service.getInactiveDevices();\n        for (String deviceToken : inactiveDevices.keySet()) {\n            Date inactiveAsOf = inactiveDevices.get(deviceToken);\n            ...\n        }\n\nThat's it!\n\nCustom Payloads\n----------------\n\nYou can send a message payload, but providing custom fields and\nlocalizable alert:\n\n    String payload = APNS.newPayload()\n                .badge(3)\n                .customField(\"secret\", \"what do you think?\")\n                .localizedKey(\"GAME_PLAY_REQUEST_FORMAT\")\n                .localizedArguments(\"Jenna\", \"Frank\")\n                .actionKey(\"Play\").build();\n\n    service.push(token, payload);\n\n\nEnhanced Notification Format\n----------------\n\nYou can use the enhanced notification format to get feedback from Apple about notifications that were unable to be processed.\n\n     String payload = APNS.newPayload()\n                .badge(3)\n                .customField(\"secret\", \"what do you think?\");\n                .localizedKey(\"GAME_PLAY_REQUEST_FORMAT\")\n                .localizedArguments(\"Jenna\", \"Frank\")\n                .actionKey(\"Play\").build();\n\n     int now =  (int)(new Date().getTime()/1000);\n\n     EnhancedApnsNotification notification = new EnhancedApnsNotification(EnhancedApnsNotification.INCREMENT_ID() /* Next ID */,\n         now + 60 * 60 /* Expire in one hour */,\n         token /* Device Token */,\n         payload);\n\n     service.push(notification);\n\n\nLicense\n----------------\n\nLicensed under the [New 3-Clause BSD License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).\n\n    Copyright 2009, Mahmood Ali.\n    All rights reserved.\n\n    Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\n    modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are\n    met:\n\n      * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n        notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n      * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above\n        copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer\n        in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the\n        distribution.\n      * Neither the name of Mahmood Ali. nor the names of its\n        contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from\n        this software without specific prior written permission.\n\n    THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS\n    \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\n    LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\n    A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

  "readme_contents": "# cinnamon-spices-applets\n\n![Validate spices](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/workflows/Validate%20spices/badge.svg)\n\nThis repository hosts all the applets available for the Cinnamon desktop environment.\n\nUsers can install spices from https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com, or directly from within Cinnamon -> System Settings.\n\n# Definitions\n\n## UUID\n\nEach spice is given a name which uniquely identifies them.\n\nThat name is their UUID and it is unique.\n\n## Author\n\nEach spice has an author.\n\nThe github username of the author is specified in the spice's info.json file.\n\n# File structure\n\nA spice can contain many files, but it should have the following file structure:\n\n- UUID/\n- UUID/info.json\n- UUID/screenshot.png\n- UUID/README.md\n- UUID/files/\n- UUID/files/UUID\n- UUID/files/UUID/metadata.json\n- UUID/files/UUID/applet.js\n- UUID/files/UUID/icon.png\n\nThere are two important directories:\n\n- UUID/ is the root level directory, it includes files which are used by the website and on github.\n- UUID/files/ represents the content of the ZIP archive which users can download from https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com or which is sent to Cinnamon when installing the spice from System Settings. This is the content which is interpreted by Cinnamon itself.\n\nAs you can see, the content of the spice isn't placed inside UUID/files/ directly, but inside UUID/files/UUID/ instead. This guarantees files aren't extracted directly onto the file system, but placed in the proper UUID directory. The presence of this UUID directory, inside of files/ isn't actually needed by Cinnamon (as Cinnamon creates it if it's missing), but it is needed to guarantee a proper manual installation (i.e. when users download the ZIP from the Cinnamon Spices website).\n\nImportant note:\n\n- The UUID/files/ directory has to be \"empty\", which means that it should contain ONLY the UUID directory. Else the spice won't be installable through System Settings.\n\nAt the root level:\n\n- info.json contains information about the spice. For instance, this is the file which contains the github username of the spice's author.\n- screenshot.png is a screenshot of the spice in action.\n- README.md is optional and can be used to show instructions and information about the spice. It appears both in Github and on the website.\n\n## Validation\n\nTo check if a spice with UUID satifies those requirements run the `validate-spice` script in this repo:\n```\n./validate-spice UUID\n```\n\n# Rights and responsibility of the author\n\nThe author is in charge of the development of the spice.\n\nAuthors can modify their spice under the following conditions:\n\n- They need to respect the file structure and workflow defined here\n- They cannot introduce malicious code or code which would have a negative impact on the environment\n\nAuthors are able to accept or refuse changes from other people which modify the features or the look of their spice.\n\nAuthors may choose to pass on development of their applet to someone else. In that case, the \"author\" field in UUID/info.json will be changed to the new developer and the \"original_author\" field will be added to give credit to the original developer.\n\nIf an author abandons their applet, the Linux Mint team will take over maintenance of the applet or pass it on to someone else. Several factors are used to determine if an applet is abandoned, including prolonged activity, failure to respond to requests, and serious breakages that have occurred due to changes in API, etc. If you plan to abandon an applet, please notify us, so we don't have to guess as to whether it is abandoned or not.\n\n# Pull requests from authors and workflow\n\nTo modify a spice, developers create a Pull Request.\n\nMembers of the cinnamon-spices-developers team review the pull request.\n\nIf the author of the pull request is the spice author (his github username matches the author field in UUID/info.json), the reviewer only has to perform the following checks:\n\n- The changes only impact spices which belong to that author\n- The changes respect the spices file structure\n- The changes do not introduce malicious code or code which would negatively impact the desktop environment\n\nIf everything is fine, the PR is merged, the website is updated and users can see a spice update in System Settings.\n\n# Pull requests from other people\n\nIn addition to the checks specified above, if the pull request comes from somebody other than the author, it will be held until the author reviews it or gives a thumbs-up, with the following exceptions:\n\n- If it is a bug fix, the PR may be merged, though if the bug is minor, or the fix could potentially impact the way the applet works, we may wait for author approval before merging.\n- If the pull request adds translations it will likewise be merged. These are not going to effect the functionality of the code, and will make the applet available to many users who couldn't use it before due to a language barrier. We view this a essentially a bugfix, but it is included here for clarification.\n- If the author fails to respond in a reasonable time, we will assume the applet is abandoned (as mentioned above) and the pull request will be merged assuming it meets all other requirements.\n\nIf the changes represent a change in functionality, or in look and feel, or if their implementation could be questioned and/or discussed, the reviewer should leave the PR open and ask the author to review it.\n\nIf the author is happy with the PR, it can then be merged. If he's not, it can either be closed or updated to reflect any changes the author requested, at which point it will either be merged or the author may be asked to review the changes depending on whether it is clear the changes fully meet the author's requirements.\n\n# Deletions\n\nAuthors are entitled to remove their spice.\n\nThe Cinnamon team is also entitled to do so. Common reasons are lack of maintenance, critical bugs, or if the features are already provided, either by Cinnamon itself, or by another spice which is more successful.\n\n# Additions\n\nNew spices can be added by Pull Request.\n\nThe Cinnamon team can accept or reject the addition and should give justification in the PR comments section.\n\n# Reporting Bugs and Creating Pull Requests\n\nSee the [Guidelines for Contributing](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n# Translations\n\nThe script `cinnamon-spices-makepot` in this repo was written to help authors to update their translation template (`.pot`) file and to help translators to test their translations.\n\nUpdating a translation template `.pot`:\n```\n./cinnamon-spices-makepot UUID\n```\n\nTest your translations `.po` locally before uploading to Spices:\"\n```\n./cinnamon-spices-makepot UUID --install\n```\n\nMore info:\n```\n./cinnamon-spices-makepot --help\n```\n\n# Translations Status Tables\n\nThe spices receive updates which sometimes contain new or updated strings that need to be translated. The translation status tables were created to give translators a better overview of the current state of translations and also to make it easier to track where new untranslated strings appear.\n\n* [Translation Status Tables for Applets](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-spices-applets/blob/translation-status-tables/.translation-tables/tables/README.md)\n\nTo ensure that these tables are always up-to-date, they are automatically regenerated whenever a new commit is pushed to the master branch.\n"

First, install git if you don't have it: (`sudo apt-get install git-core`, `sudo pacman -S git`, etc.), then run:\n\n    GIT_PROJECTS=~/git_projects\n    PROJECT_NAME=gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet\n    mkdir $GIT_PROJECTS\n    cd $GIT_PROJECTS\n    git clone git://github.com/paradoxxxzero/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet.git $PROJECT_NAME\n    mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions\n    cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions\n    { [ -d \"./$PROJECT_NAME\" ] || [ -L \"./$PROJECT_NAME\" ]; } && rm -Rf \"./$PROJECT_NAME\"\n    ln -s $GIT_PROJECTS/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet/$PROJECT_NAME\n    gnome-shell-extension-tool --enable-extension=$PROJECT_NAME\n    gnome-extensions enable system-monitor@paradoxxx.zero.gmail.com\n\nAnd reload GNOME Shell (`Alt + F2`, then `r`) or restart your GNOME session if you are using Wayland.\n\nOn openSUSE you need to install a devel package that provides the `gnome-shell-extension-tool` command:\n\n    sudo zypper install gnome-shell-devel\n\n### Development\n\n#### Translation\n\nIf we do not have the translation for your language and you want to translate it by yourself, please make a fork, add your `po/<YOUR_LANG>/system-monitor-applet.po` file, and make a pull request.\n\n#### Testing\n\nTesting can be done on your native Linux environment using the install instructions above, or through Docker.\n\nTo build and run a Docker image:\n\n    ./build-docker.sh\n    ./run-docker.sh\n\nTo connect to the container's desktop through VNC:\n\n    ./open-docker.sh\n\nOnce logged in, you'll still need to manually enable the extension by open the Gnome Tweaks tool.\n\nAfterwards, when you're done testing, you can destroy the container with:\n\n    ./close-docker.sh\n\n#### Deployment\n    \n1. To create a ZIP file with the specified version number, ready to upload to [GNOME Shell Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/) or similar repository, run:\n\n    make zip-file VERSION=<version>\n\nTo determine the version number to use, check the extensions site and increment from the largest published version.\n\nThe specified version number is just for documentation and isn't strictly necessary in the uploaded file, since the extensions website will dynamically set this and override whatever we enter.\n\n2. Once uploaded, [create a GitHub release](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet/releases) with the same version number.\n\n### Authors\n\n[paradoxxxzero](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero)\n[yuyichao](https://github.com/yuyichao)\n[darkxst](https://github.com/darkxst)\nand [many contributors](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/gnome-shell-system-monitor-applet/contributors)\n\n### License\n\nCopyright (C) 2011 Florian Mounier aka paradoxxxzero\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

If you're interested in building your own backend to plug into this tool, here's what my database and endpoints look like:\n\n### Database\nThere are six required columns: \n- `name`: The name of the song\n- `artist`: The artist name\n- `album`: The album name\n- `track`: The index of the song relative to the album (To order songs in an album)\n- `url`: A URL to the audio file\n- `artwork`: A URL to the album artwork image\n```mysql\nmysql> use music;\n\nDatabase changed\nmysql> desc tracks;\n+------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+\n| Field      | Type             | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |\n+------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+\n| id         | int(10) unsigned | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |\n| created_at | timestamp        | YES  |     | NULL    |                |\n| updated_at | timestamp        | YES  |     | NULL    |                |\n| name       | varchar(255)     | NO   |     | NULL    |                |\n| artist     | varchar(255)     | NO   |     | NULL    |                |\n| album      | varchar(255)     | NO   |     | NULL    |                |\n| track      | int(11)          | NO   |     | NULL    |                |\n| url        | varchar(255)     | NO   |     | NULL    |                |\n| artwork    | varchar(255)     | NO   |     | NULL    |                |\n+------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+\n9 rows in set (0.05 sec)\n```\n\n### API Endpoints\nThe backend is built with PHP using the Laravel ORM. I only needed a few API endpoints to get this working:\n- `/albums` - Returns a list of all album names with their corresponding artist\n- `/album/{album}` - Returns a list of songs from a specified album\n- `/artists` - Returns a list of all artists\n- `/artist/{artist}` - Returns a list of all albums from a specific artist\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have questions!\n\n## Local Development\nTo run this app locally, clone the project (or download it as a zip and unzip it to a directory), navigate to the root directory with a command prompt or terminal (where the package.json file is located), and run npm install to download the necessary dependencies onto your local machine.\n\nInside the root directory, you can run some built-in commands:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\nRuns the app in development mode.\n\nOpen http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.\n\nThe page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.\n\nYou will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.\n\n```\nnpm run build\n```\nBuilds the app for production to the build folder.\n\nIt correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\n\nThe build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\n\nYour app is ready to be deployed.\n"

  "readme_contents": "# [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) for iOS and macOS\n\nThis project contains an application for iOS and for macOS, as well as many components shared between the two of them. You may toggle between the two platforms by selecting the target from within Xcode.\n\n## Building\n\n- Clone this repo:\n\n```\n$ git clone https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-apple\n$ cd wireguard-apple\n```\n\n- Rename and populate developer team ID file:\n\n```\n$ cp Sources/WireGuardApp/Config/Developer.xcconfig.template Sources/WireGuardApp/Config/Developer.xcconfig\n$ vim Sources/WireGuardApp/Config/Developer.xcconfig\n```\n\n- Install swiftlint and go 1.15:\n\n```\n$ brew install swiftlint go\n```\n\n- Open project in Xcode:\n\n```\n$ open WireGuard.xcodeproj\n```\n\n- Flip switches, press buttons, and make whirling noises until Xcode builds it.\n\n## WireGuardKit integration\n\n1. Open your Xcode project and add the Swift package with the following URL:\n   \n   ```\n   https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-apple\n   ```\n   \n2. `WireGuardKit` links against `wireguard-go-bridge` library, but it cannot build it automatically\n   due to Swift package manager limitations. So it needs a little help from a developer. \n   Please follow the instructions below to create a build target(s) for `wireguard-go-bridge`.\n   \n   - In Xcode, click File -> New -> Target. Switch to \"Other\" tab and choose \"External Build \n     System\".\n   - Type in `WireGuardGoBridge<PLATFORM>` under the \"Product name\", replacing the `<PLATFORM>` \n     placeholder with the name of the platform. For example, when targeting macOS use `macOS`, or \n     when targeting iOS use `iOS`.\n     Make sure the build tool is set to: `/usr/bin/make` (default).\n   - In the appeared \"Info\" tab of a newly created target, type in the \"Directory\" path under \n     the \"External Build Tool Configuration\":\n     \n     ```\n     ${BUILD_DIR%Build/*}SourcePackages/checkouts/wireguard-apple/Sources/WireGuardKitGo\n     ```\n     \n   - Switch to \"Build Settings\" and find `SDKROOT`.\n     Type in `macosx` if you target macOS, or type in `iphoneos` if you target iOS.\n   \n3. Go to Xcode project settings and locate your network extension target and switch to \n   \"Build Phases\" tab.\n   \n   - Locate \"Dependencies\" section and hit \"+\" to add `WireGuardGoBridge<PLATFORM>` replacing \n     the `<PLATFORM>` placeholder with the name of platform matching the network extension \n     deployment target (i.e macOS or iOS).\n     \n   - Locate the \"Link with binary libraries\" section and hit \"+\" to add `WireGuardKit`.\n   \n4. In Xcode project settings, locate your main bundle app and switch to \"Build Phases\" tab. \n   Locate the \"Link with binary libraries\" section and hit \"+\" to add `WireGuardKit`.\n   \n5. iOS only: Locate Bitcode settings under your application target, Build settings -> Enable Bitcode, \n   change the corresponding value to \"No\".\n   \nNote that if you ship your app for both iOS and macOS, make sure to repeat the steps 2-4 twice, \nonce per platform.\n\n## MIT License\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

  "readme_contents": "[![Reference Status](https://www.versioneye.com/objective-c/reachability/reference_badge.svg?style=flat)](https://www.versioneye.com/objective-c/reachability/references)\n\n# **WARNING** there have been reports of apps being rejected when Reachability is used in a framework. The only solution to this so far is to rename the class.\n\n# Reachability\n\nThis is a drop-in replacement for Apple's `Reachability` class. It is ARC-compatible, and it uses the new GCD methods to notify of network interface changes.\n\nIn addition to the standard `NSNotification`, it supports the use of blocks for when the network becomes reachable and unreachable.\n\nFinally, you can specify whether a WWAN connection is considered \"reachable\".\n\n*DO NOT OPEN BUGS UNTIL YOU HAVE TESTED ON DEVICE*\n\n**BEFORE YOU OPEN A BUG ABOUT iOS6/iOS5 build errors, use Tag 3.2 or 3.1 as they support assign types**\n\n## Requirements\n\nOnce you have added the `.h/m` files to your project, simply:\n\n* Go to the `Project->TARGETS->Build Phases->Link Binary With Libraries`.\n* Press the plus in the lower left of the list.\n* Add `SystemConfiguration.framework`.\n\nBoom, you're done.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Block Example\n\nThis sample uses blocks to notify when the interface state has changed. The blocks will be called on a **BACKGROUND THREAD**, so you need to dispatch UI updates onto the main thread.\n\n#### In Objective-C\n\n```objc\n// Allocate a reachability object\nReachability* reach = [Reachability reachabilityWithHostname:@\"www.google.com\"];\n\n// Set the blocks\nreach.reachableBlock = ^(Reachability*reach)\n{\n    // keep in mind this is called on a background thread\n    // and if you are updating the UI it needs to happen\n    // on the main thread, like this:\n\n    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\n        NSLog(@\"REACHABLE!\");\n    });\n};\n\nreach.unreachableBlock = ^(Reachability*reach)\n{\n    NSLog(@\"UNREACHABLE!\");\n};\n\n// Start the notifier, which will cause the reachability object to retain itself!\n[reach startNotifier];\n```\n\n### In Swift 3\n\n```swift\nimport Reachability\n\nvar reach: Reachability?\n\nfunc application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {\n        // Allocate a reachability object\n        self.reach = Reachability.forInternetConnection()\n        \n        // Set the blocks\n        self.reach!.reachableBlock = {\n            (reach: Reachability?) -> Void in\n            \n            // keep in mind this is called on a background thread\n            // and if you are updating the UI it needs to happen\n            // on the main thread, like this:\n            DispatchQueue.main.async {\n                print(\"REACHABLE!\")\n            }\n        }\n        \n        self.reach!.unreachableBlock = {\n            (reach: Reachability?) -> Void in\n            print(\"UNREACHABLE!\")\n        }\n        \n        self.reach!.startNotifier()\n    \n        return true\n}\n```\n\n### `NSNotification` Example\n\nThis sample will use `NSNotification`s to notify when the interface has changed. They will be delivered on the **MAIN THREAD**, so you *can* do UI updates from within the function.\n\nIn addition, it asks the `Reachability` object to consider the WWAN (3G/EDGE/CDMA) as a non-reachable connection (you might use this if you are writing a video streaming app, for example, to save the user's data plan).\n\n#### In Objective-C\n\n```objc\n// Allocate a reachability object\nReachability* reach = [Reachability reachabilityWithHostname:@\"www.google.com\"];\n\n// Tell the reachability that we DON'T want to be reachable on 3G/EDGE/CDMA\nreach.reachableOnWWAN = NO;\n\n// Here we set up a NSNotification observer. The Reachability that caused the notification\n// is passed in the object parameter\n[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self\n                                         selector:@selector(reachabilityChanged:)\n                                             name:kReachabilityChangedNotification\n                                           object:nil];\n\n[reach startNotifier];\n```\n\n#### In Swift 3\n\n```swift\nimport Reachability\n\nvar reach: Reachability?\n\nfunc application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {\n    // Allocate a reachability object\n    self.reach = Reachability.forInternetConnection()\n    \n    // Tell the reachability that we DON'T want to be reachable on 3G/EDGE/CDMA\n    self.reach!.reachableOnWWAN = false\n    \n    // Here we set up a NSNotification observer. The Reachability that caused the notification\n    // is passed in the object parameter\n    NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(\n        self,\n        selector: #selector(reachabilityChanged),\n        name: NSNotification.Name.reachabilityChanged,\n        object: nil\n    )\n    \n    self.reach!.startNotifier()\n    \n    return true\n}\n        \nfunc reachabilityChanged(notification: NSNotification) {\n    if self.reach!.isReachableViaWiFi() || self.reach!.isReachableViaWWAN() {\n        print(\"Service available!!!\")\n    } else {\n        print(\"No service available!!!\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Tell the world\n\nHead over to [Projects using Reachability](https://github.com/tonymillion/Reachability/wiki/Projects-using-Reachability) and add your project for \"Maximum Wins!\".\n"

  "language": "AppleScript",
  "readme_contents": "WARNING\n-------\n\nTHIS REPO IS NO LONGER BEING KEPT UP WITH SINCE APPLE HAS DONE AWAY WITH THE NEED FOR AN APPLE ID FOR EVERY DEVICE.\n\nIF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THIS PROJECT, I WILL KEEP AN EYE ON IT AND TEST AND MERGE PULL REQUESTS.\n\n\nBatch Apple ID Creator\n----------------------\n\n### Purpose & Features\n\nDeploying a great quantity of iOS devices means creating a great\nquantity of Apple IDs. This script allows automated Apple ID creation\nfrom a spreadsheet. Apple IDs are created without a credit card, which\nis great for many deployments. There is a \u201cdry run\u201d feature to test the\nscript without actually creating the Apple ID.\n\n### Requirements\n\n-   **IMPORTANT**: Apple uses a velocity check to prevent too many Apple\n    IDs from a single IP address. You must contact your Apple business\n    representative to request that your IP address is whitelisted for a\n    short time.\n-   Being [AppleScript][], this runs only on Macs.\n-   Last tested successfully using[iTunes][] 12.4.3 on Mac OS 10.11.6 (El Capitan). Future versions may break the\n    script.\n-   [UI Scripting][] allows us to script otherwise non-scriptbale\n    interfaces. Turn this on in System Preferences \\> Accessibility and\n    check \u201cEnable access for assistive devices.\u201d\n-   Apple has [strong password requirements][]. Account creation will\n    fail if the passwords are too weak.\n\n### Instructions\n\nA template CSV file is included. Create csv file. Then run the script.\nWhen running this via Script Editor, the Messages tab of the log will show the account being created\nto help you recover and start where you left off if a script error occurs.\n\n\n#### CSV file tips\n\n* keep the column headers,\n* fill out all columns,\n* use comma as a column separator,\n* don't leave empty lines,\n* use MS Excel or Numbers to create file,\n* don't include the \"- \" in front of the security questions,\n* leave last column blank,\n* for the state just use the two letter initial, ie \"NY\" not \"NY - New York\" as its listed in iTunes,\n* for the month in birth date use month names with capital first letter, ie \"January\" for january,\n\n\n### Security Questions\n\nAs of iTunes 10.6.1 Apple has required three security questions. The\nBatch Apple ID Creator allows you to choose the questions from the list\nbelow. Each question should be copied into the appropriate spreadsheet\ncolumn (Security Question 1, 2 or 3) exactly as typed below.\n\n#### Security Question 1\n\n-   What is the first name of your best friend in high school?\n-   What was the name of your first pet?\n-   What was the first thing you learned to cook?\n-   What was the first film you saw in the theater?\n-   Where did you go the first time you flew on a plane?\n-   What is the last name of your favorite elementary school teacher?\n\n#### Security Question 2\n\n-   What is your dream job?\n-   What is your favorite children\u2019s book?\n-   What was the model of your first car?\n-   What was your childhood nickname?\n-   Who was your favorite film star or character in school?\n-   Who was your favorite singer or band in high school?\n\n#### Security Question 3\n\n-   In what city did your parents meet?\n-   What was the first name of your first boss?\n-   What is the name of the street where you grew up?\n-   What is the name of the first beach you visited?\n-   What was the first album that you purchased?\n-   What is the name of your favorite sports team?\n\n### Known Bugs\n\nErrors are not handled gracefully. Although some errors are recoverable,\nif the script stops, it loses track of its progress. Edit the\nspreadsheet to continue.\n\nAt the end of this script, Apple will send a verification email to the\nApple ID. To complete verification, click the link in the message, then\nre-enter the account address and password.\n\n### Download\n\nThe files are downloadable from GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/brandonusher/Apple-ID-AppleScript Feel free to fork\nand improve.\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nThis script was originally created by Enterprise iOS user [Greg\nMoore][], who works for Hope Public Schools in Hope, Arkansas. [Aaron\nFreimark][] then updated the script to work with iTunes 10.6.1 and the\nmultiple recovery questions. Discuss on [EnterpriseiOS.com][]. This\nscript or derivatives must not be sold. If you make it better, please\ngive back to the community that brought it to you.\n\nThe base for this script was created by [Aaron Freimark][1]\n\nUpdated version brought to you by [Brandon Usher][]\n\n  [AppleScript]: http://developer.apple.com/applescript/\n  [iTunes]: http://www.apple.com/itunes/\n  [UI Scripting]: http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.21/21.06/UserInterfaceScripting/index.html\n  [strong password requirements]: http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1728\n  [Greg Moore]: http://www.enterpriseios.com/users/Eight_Quarter_Bit\n  [Aaron Freimark]: http://www.enterpriseios.com/users/Aaron_Freimark\n  [EnterpriseiOS.com]: http://www.enterpriseios.com/wiki/Batch_Apple_ID_Generator\n  [1]: https://github.com/aaronfreimark/Apple-ID-AppleScript\n  [Brandon Usher]: https://github.com/brandonusher\n"

Compilation is still performed by the existing\n[`objc_library` rule](https://bazel.build/reference/be/objective-c#objc_library)\nin Bazel, and by the\n[`swift_library` rule](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_swift/blob/master/doc/rules.md#swift_library)\navailable from [rules_swift](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_swift).\n\nIf you are looking for an easy way to build mixed language frameworks, check out [rules_ios](https://github.com/bazel-ios/rules_ios).\n\n## Reference documentation\n\n[Click here](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/tree/master/doc)\nfor the reference documentation for the rules and other definitions in this\nrepository.\n\n## Quick setup\n\nAdd the following to your `WORKSPACE` file to add the external repositories,\nreplacing the version number in the `tag` attribute with the version of the\nrules you wish to depend on:\n\n```python\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\n\nhttp_archive(\n    name = \"build_bazel_rules_apple\",\n    sha256 = \"36072d4f3614d309d6a703da0dfe48684ec4c65a89611aeb9590b45af7a3e592\",\n    url = \"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/releases/download/1.0.1/rules_apple.1.0.1.tar.gz\",\n)\n\nload(\n    \"@build_bazel_rules_apple//apple:repositories.bzl\",\n    \"apple_rules_dependencies\",\n)\n\napple_rules_dependencies()\n\nload(\n    \"@build_bazel_rules_swift//swift:repositories.bzl\",\n    \"swift_rules_dependencies\",\n)\n\nswift_rules_dependencies()\n\nload(\n    \"@build_bazel_rules_swift//swift:extras.bzl\",\n    \"swift_rules_extra_dependencies\",\n)\n\nswift_rules_extra_dependencies()\n\nload(\n    \"@build_bazel_apple_support//lib:repositories.bzl\",\n    \"apple_support_dependencies\",\n)\n\napple_support_dependencies()\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nMinimal example:\n\n```python\nload(\"@build_bazel_rules_apple//apple:ios.bzl\", \"ios_application\")\n\nobjc_library(\n    name = \"Lib\",\n    srcs = glob([\n        \"**/*.h\",\n        \"**/*.m\",\n    ]),\n    data = [\n        \":Main.storyboard\",\n    ],\n)\n\n# Links code from \"deps\" into an executable, collects and compiles resources\n# from \"deps\" and places them with the executable in an .app bundle, and then\n# outputs an .ipa with the bundle in its Payload directory.\nios_application(\n    name = \"App\",\n    bundle_id = \"com.example.app\",\n    families = [\"iphone\", \"ipad\"],\n    infoplists = [\":Info.plist\"],\n    minimum_os_version = \"15.0\",\n    deps = [\":Lib\"],\n)\n```\n\nSee the [examples](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/tree/master/examples)\ndirectory for sample applications.\n\n## Supported bazel versions\n\nrules_apple and rules_swift are often affected by changes in bazel\nitself. This means you generally need to update these rules as you\nupdate bazel.\n\nYou can also see the supported bazel versions in the notes for each\nrelease on the [releases\npage](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/releases).\n\nBesides these constraint this repo follows [semver](https://semver.org/)\nas best as we can since the 1.0.0 release.\n\n| Bazel release | Minimum supported rules version | Final supported rules version | Supporting Branch |\n|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|\n| 6.x (most recent rolling) | 0.34.2 | current | `master` |\n| 5.x | 0.33.0 | 1.* | `bazel/5.x` |\n| 4.x | 0.30.0 | 0.32.0 | N/A |\n| 3.x | 0.20.0 | 0.21.2 | N/A |\n"

So, after each write to the server, the Push class waits for the \"read stream\" to change its status (or at least N microseconds); if it happened and the client socket receives an \"end-of-file\" from the server, the notification pushed to the server was broken, the Apple server has closed the connection and the client needs to reconnect to send other notifications still on the message queue.\n\nTo speed-up the sending activities the Push Server class can be used to create a Push Notification Server with many processes that reads a common message queue and sends parallel Push Notifications.\n\nAll client-server activities are based on the \"on error, retry\" pattern with customizable timeouts, retry times and retry intervals.\n\nRequirements\n-------------\n\nPHP 5.3.0 or later with OpenSSL, PCNTL, System V shared memory and semaphore support.\n\n```\n./configure --with-openssl[=PATH] --enable-pcntl --enable-sysvshm --enable-sysvsem\n```\n\nIf you plan to use only Push and Feedback provider without the Server part you need only OpenSSL (no PCNTL, System V shared memory or semaphore):\n\n```\n./configure --with-openssl[=PATH]\n```\n\n*Usually OpenSSL is built-in in standard PHP Linux distributions packages. \nStandard PHP 5.3.0 shipped with Mac OS X Snow Leopard just works.*\n\nPlease...\n---------\n... drop a line if you use ApnsPHP for your published application on the App Store! Thanks :-)\n"

If not, please follow the official React Native documentation for getting started: [React Native getting started documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started).\n\n- (iOS only) You are using Xcode version `11` or higher. This will allow you to develop using iOS version `13` and higher, when the APIs for Sign In with Apple became available.\n\n- **Once you're sure you've met the above, please follow our [Initial development environment setup](docs/INITIAL_SETUP.md) guide.**\n\n## Version 2.0.0 breaking changes\nVersion 2 added Android support and introduced a few breaking changes with how methods are accessed. Please see the [Migration Guide](docs/MIGRATION.md).\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nyarn add @invertase/react-native-apple-authentication\n\n(cd ios && pod install)\n```\n\nYou will not have to manually link this module as it supports React Native auto-linking.\n\n## Usage\n\nBelow are simple steps to help you get up and running. The implementation differs between iOS an Android, so if you're having trouble, be sure to look through the docs. Please skip and head to the full code examples noted below if you prefer to see a more complete implementation:\n\n- [React Hooks example (iOS)](example/app.ios.js)\n- [React Class example (iOS)](example/classVersion.js)\n- [React Hooks example (Android)](example/app.android.js)\n- [Auth0 Implementation](docs/Auth0.md)\n- If you're authenticating users via `React Native Firebase`; see our [Firebase guide](docs/FIREBASE.md)\n- For Android support, a couple extra steps are required on your Apple developer account. Checkout [our guide](docs/ANDROID_EXTRA.md) for more info.\n\n\n### iOS\n\n#### 1. Initial set-up\n\nImport the `appleAuth` ([API documentation](docs/interfaces/_lib_index_d_.md#66)) module and the `AppleButton` ([API documentation](docs/interfaces/_lib_index_d_.applebuttonprops.md)) exported member element from the `@invertase/react-native-apple-authentication` library. Setup an event handler (`onPress`) to kick start the authentication request.\n\n```js\n// App.js\n\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { View } from 'react-native';\nimport { AppleButton } from '@invertase/react-native-apple-authentication';\n\nasync function onAppleButtonPress() {\n\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <View>\n      <AppleButton\n        buttonStyle={AppleButton.Style.WHITE}\n        buttonType={AppleButton.Type.SIGN_IN}\n        style={{\n          width: 160, // You must specify a width\n          height: 45, // You must specify a height\n        }}\n        onPress={() => onAppleButtonPress()}\n      />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Implement the login process\n```js\n// App.js\n\nimport { appleAuth } from '@invertase/react-native-apple-authentication';\n\nasync function onAppleButtonPress() {\n  // performs login request\n  const appleAuthRequestResponse = await appleAuth.performRequest({\n    requestedOperation: appleAuth.Operation.LOGIN,\n    requestedScopes: [appleAuth.Scope.EMAIL, appleAuth.Scope.FULL_NAME],\n  });\n\n  // get current authentication state for user\n  // /!\\ This method must be tested on a real device. On the iOS simulator it always throws an error.\n  const credentialState = await appleAuth.getCredentialStateForUser(appleAuthRequestResponse.user);\n\n  // use credentialState response to ensure the user is authenticated\n  if (credentialState === appleAuth.State.AUTHORIZED) {\n    // user is authenticated\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Event Listener\n\nSet up event listener for when user's credentials have been revoked.\n\n```js\n// App.js\n\nimport React, { useEffect } from 'react';\nimport { View } from 'react-native';\nimport { appleAuth, AppleButton } from '@invertase/react-native-apple-authentication';\n\nfunction App() {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // onCredentialRevoked returns a function that will remove the event listener. useEffect will call this function when the component unmounts\n    return appleAuth.onCredentialRevoked(async () => {\n      console.warn('If this function executes, User Credentials have been Revoked');\n    });\n  }, []); // passing in an empty array as the second argument ensures this is only ran once when component mounts initially.\n\n  return (\n    <View>\n      <AppleButton onPress={() => onAppleButtonPress()} />\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 4. Implement the logout process\n\nThere is an operation `appleAuth.Operation.LOGOUT`, however it does not work as expected and is not even being used by Apple in their example code. See [this issue for more information](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-apple-authentication/issues/10#issuecomment-611532131)\n\nSo it is recommended when logging out to just clear all data you have from a user, collected during `appleAuth.Operation.LOGIN`.\n\n### Android\n\n#### 1. Initial set-up\nMake sure to correctly configure your Apple developer account to allow for proper authentication on Android. You can checkout [our guide](docs/ANDROID_EXTRA.md) for more info.\n```js\n// App.js\n\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { View } from 'react-native';\nimport { appleAuthAndroid, AppleButton } from '@invertase/react-native-apple-authentication';\n\nasync function onAppleButtonPress() {\n}\n\n// Apple authentication requires API 19+, so we check before showing the login button\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <View>\n      {appleAuthAndroid.isSupported && (\n        <AppleButton\n          buttonStyle={AppleButton.Style.WHITE}\n          buttonType={AppleButton.Type.SIGN_IN}\n          onPress={() => onAppleButtonPress()}\n        />\n      )}\n    </View>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Implement the login process\n```js\n// App.js\n\nimport { appleAuthAndroid } from '@invertase/react-native-apple-authentication';\nimport 'react-native-get-random-values';\nimport { v4 as uuid } from 'uuid'\n\nasync function onAppleButtonPress() {\n  // Generate secure, random values for state and nonce\n  const rawNonce = uuid();\n  const state = uuid();\n\n  // Configure the request\n  appleAuthAndroid.configure({\n    // The Service ID you registered with Apple\n    clientId: 'com.example.client-android',\n\n    // Return URL added to your Apple dev console. We intercept this redirect, but it must still match\n    // the URL you provided to Apple. It can be an empty route on your backend as it's never called.\n    redirectUri: 'https://example.com/auth/callback',\n\n    // The type of response requested - code, id_token, or both.\n    responseType: appleAuthAndroid.ResponseType.ALL,\n\n    // The amount of user information requested from Apple.\n    scope: appleAuthAndroid.Scope.ALL,\n\n    // Random nonce value that will be SHA256 hashed before sending to Apple.\n    nonce: rawNonce,\n\n    // Unique state value used to prevent CSRF attacks. A UUID will be generated if nothing is provided.\n    state,\n  });\n\n  // Open the browser window for user sign in\n  const response = await appleAuthAndroid.signIn();\n\n  // Send the authorization code to your backend for verification\n}\n```\n\n\n### MacOS\n\nThis library works on MacOS 10.15+ if using in conjunction with [react-native-macos](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos).\n\n\n### Web (not react-native-web, but that may come as a follow-on, this is pure web at the moment)\n\n#### 1. Initial set-up\n- Ensure you follow the android steps above.\n- Install the [web counterpart](https://github.com/A-Tokyo/react-apple-signin-auth) `yarn add react-apple-signin-auth` in your web project.\n\n#### 2. Implement the login process on web\n```js\nimport AppleSignin from 'react-apple-signin-auth';\n\n/** Apple Signin button */\nconst MyAppleSigninButton = ({ ...rest }) => (\n  <AppleSignin\n    /** Auth options passed to AppleID.auth.init() */\n    authOptions={{\n      clientId: 'SAME AS ANDROID',\n      redirectURI: 'SAME AS ANDROID',\n      scope: 'email name',\n      state: 'state',\n      /** sha256 nonce before sending to apple to unify with native firebase behavior - https://github.com/invertase/react-native-apple-authentication/issues/28 */\n      nonce: sha256('nonce'),\n      /** We have to usePopup since we need clientSide authentication */\n      usePopup: true,\n    }}\n    onSuccess={(response) => {\n      console.log(response);\n      // {\n      //     \"authorization\": {\n      //       \"state\": \"[STATE]\",\n      //       \"code\": \"[CODE]\",\n      //       \"id_token\": \"[ID_TOKEN]\"\n      //     },\n      //     \"user\": {\n      //       \"email\": \"[EMAIL]\",\n      //       \"name\": {\n      //         \"firstName\": \"[FIRST_NAME]\",\n      //         \"lastName\": \"[LAST_NAME]\"\n      //       }\n      //     }\n      // }\n    }}\n  />\n);\n\nexport default MyAppleSigninButton;\n```\n\n#### 3. Verify serverside\n- Send the apple response to your server.\n- See [Serverside Verification](#serverside-verification)\n- Ensure that you pass the clientID as the web service ID, not the native app bundle. Since the project utilizes the service ID for authenticating web and android.\n\n## Serverside verification\n\n#### Nonce\n\n- Based on the [Firebase implementation guidelines](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/apple#sign_in_with_apple_and_authenticate_with_firebase) the nonce provided to `appleAuth.performRequest` (iOS) and `appleAuthAndroid.configure` (Android) is automatically SHA256-hashed.\n- To verify the nonce serverside you first need to hash the nonce value, ie:\n  ```js\n  crypto.createHash('sha256').update(nonce).digest('hex');\n  ```\n- The nonce can then be easily compared serverside for extra security verification, ie:\n  ```js\n  import crypto from 'crypto';\n  import appleSigninAuth from 'apple-signin-auth';\n\n  appleIdTokenClaims = await appleSigninAuth.verifyIdToken(id_token, {\n    /** sha256 hex hash of raw nonce */\n    nonce: nonce ? crypto.createHash('sha256').update(nonce).digest('hex') : undefined,\n  });\n  ```\n\n## API Reference Documentation\n\nAll API documentation is generated by typedoc, and [is available in the `typedocs` folder](typedocs/modules.md)\n\n## FAQs\n\n1. Why does `full name` and `email` return `null`?\n   - Apple only returns the `full name` and `email` on the first login, it will return `null` on the succeeding login so you need to save those data.\n   - For testing purposes, to be receive these again, go to your device settings; `Settings > Apple ID, iCloud, iTunes & App Store > Password & Security > Apps Using Your Apple ID`, tap on your app and tap `Stop Using Apple ID`. You can now sign-in again and you'll receive the `full name` and `email.\n   - Keep in mind you can always access the `email` property server-side by inspecting the `id_token` returned from Apple when verifying the user.\n\n2. How to change button language? (iOS)\n    - Native Apple Button component reads language value from CFBundleDevelopmentRegion at Info.plist file. By changing CFBundleDevelopmentRegion value you can change default language for component.\n    ```XML\n    <key>CFBundleDevelopmentRegion</key>\n    <string>en</string>\n    ```\n    - For supporting multi language, you can add CFBundleAllowMixedLocalizations key to Info.plist.\n    ```XML\n    <key>CFBundleAllowMixedLocalizations</key>\n    <string>true</string>\n    ```\n3. How do I get the email after the first login?\n    - You can get the email address by parsing the JWT token that's returned from any authentication, like so:\n    ```js\n    import { appleAuth } from '@invertase/react-native-apple-authentication';\n    import jwt_decode from 'jwt-decode';\n\n    const appleAuthRequestResponse = await appleAuth.performRequest({\n      requestedOperation: appleAuth.Operation.LOGIN,\n      requestedScopes: [appleAuth.Scope.EMAIL, appleAuth.Scope.FULL_NAME]\n    });\n    // other fields are available, but full name is not\n    const { email, email_verified, is_private_email, sub } = jwt_decode(appleAuthRequestResponse.identityToken)\n    ```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n```\nThe operation couldn\u2019t be completed. (com.apple.AuthenticationServices.AuthorizationError error 1000.)\n```\n\n###### Case 1:\nCheck that the connection settings have been made correctly.\nThe setup can be found here: [Initial Setup](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-apple-authentication/blob/main/docs/INITIAL_SETUP.md)\n\n###### Case 2:\nIf you are using the function `getCredentialStateForUser` on a simulator, this error will always be triggered, for the reason that this function verifies the authenticity of the device.\n\nYou must test your code on a real device.\n\n###### Case 3:\nIf you are using a simulator, go to [Manage Apple Account](https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage).\n\nSearch for \"Devices\", select \"Simulator\" and press \"Remove from Account\".\n\n  ![show-devices](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invertase/react-native-apple-authentication/main/docs/images/devices-list.jpg)\n\n  ![remove-from-manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invertase/react-native-apple-authentication/main/docs/images/remove-simulator-devices-list.jpg)\n\nIt should work fine.\n\n```\n\"invalid_client\" in Android webview\n```\nMake sure to read the Android [services setup docs](docs/ANDROID_EXTRA.md).\n\n###### Case 1:\nThe `clientId` you passed to `appleAuthAndroid.configure` doesn't match the Service ID you setup in your Apple developer console.\n\n###### Case 2:\nYour Service ID is attached to the wrong Primary App ID, and therefore uses the incorrect Sign In with Apple key.\n\n###### Case 3:\nThe `redirectUri` you passed to `appleAuthAndroid.configure` doesn't match one of the return URLs or domains/subdomains you added in your Apple developer console. The URL must match *exactly*, and cannot contain a query string.\n\n## License\n\n- See [LICENSE](/LICENSE)\n\n---\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://invertase.io/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=footer&utm_campaign=react-native-firebase\">\n    <img width=\"75px\" src=\"https://static.invertase.io/assets/invertase/invertase-rounded-avatar.png\">\n  </a>\n  <p align=\"center\">\n    Built and maintained by <a href=\"https://invertase.io/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=footer&utm_campaign=react-native-firebase\">Invertase</a>.\n  </p>\n</p>\n"

Ready for use on iOS 10+\n\n## Installation\n\n### CocoaPods:\n\n[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate `SPStorkController` into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:\n\n```ruby\npod 'SPStorkController'\n```\n\n### Carthage\n\n[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate `SPStorkController` into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:\n\n```ogdl\ngithub \"ivanvorobei/SPStorkController\"\n```\n\n### Swift Package Manager\n\nThe [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. It\u2019s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.\n\nTo integrate `SPStorkController` into your Xcode project using Xcode 11, specify it in `Project > Swift Packages`:\n\n```ogdl\nhttps://github.com/ivanvorobei/SPStorkController\n```\n\n### Manually\n\nIf you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate `SPStorkController` into your project manually. Put `Source/SPStorkController` folder in your Xcode project. Make sure to enable `Copy items if needed` and `Create groups`.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nCreate controller and call func `presentAsStork`:\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\nimport SPStorkController\n\nclass ViewController: UIViewController {\n    \n    override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {\n        super.viewDidAppear(animated)\n\n        let controller = UIViewController()\n        self.presentAsStork(controller)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf you want customize controller (remove indicator, set custom height and other), create controller and set `transitioningDelegate` to `SPStorkTransitioningDelegate` object. Use `present` or `dismiss` functions:\n\n```swift\nlet controller = UIViewController()\nlet transitionDelegate = SPStorkTransitioningDelegate()\ncontroller.transitioningDelegate = transitionDelegate\ncontroller.modalPresentationStyle = .custom\ncontroller.modalPresentationCapturesStatusBarAppearance = true\nself.present(controller, animated: true, completion: nil)\n```\n\nPlease, do not init `SPStorkTransitioningDelegate` like this:\n\n```swift\ncontroller.transitioningDelegate = SPStorkTransitioningDelegate()\n```\n\nYou will get an error about weak property.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Light StatusBar\n\nTo set light status bar for presented controller, use `preferredStatusBarStyle` property. Also set `modalPresentationCapturesStatusBarAppearance`. See example:\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\n\nclass ModalViewController: UIViewController {\n    \n    override var preferredStatusBarStyle: UIStatusBarStyle {\n        return .lightContent\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Custom Height\n\nProperty `customHeight` sets custom height for controller. Default is `nil`:\n\n```swift\ntransitionDelegate.customHeight = 350\n```\n\n### Close Button\n\nProperty `showCloseButton` added circle button with dismiss action. Default is `false`:\n```swift\ntransitionDelegate.showCloseButton = false\n```\n\n### Arrow Indicator\n\nOn the top of controller you can add arrow indicator with animatable states. It simple configure.\nProperty `showIndicator` shows or hides top arrow indicator. Default is `true`:\n\n```swift\ntransitionDelegate.showIndicator = true\n```\n\nProperty Parameter `indicatorColor` for customize color of arrow. Default is `gray`:\n\n```swift\ntransitionDelegate.indicatorColor = UIColor.white\n```\n\nProperty `hideIndicatorWhenScroll` shows or hides indicator when scrolling. Default is `false`:\n\n```swift\ntransitionDelegate.hideIndicatorWhenScroll = true\n```\n\nYou can set always line or arrow indicator. Set `indicatorMode`:\n\n```swift\ntransitionDelegate.indicatorMode = .alwaysLine\n```\n\n### Dismissing\n\nYou can also configure events that will dimiss the controller.\nProperty `swipeToDismissEnabled` enables dismissal by swipe gesture. Default is `true`:\n\n```swift\ntransitionDelegate.swipeToDismissEnabled = true\n```\n\nProperty `translateForDismiss` sets how much need to swipe down to close the controller. Work only if `swipeToDismissEnabled` is true. Default is `240`:\n\n```swift\ntransitionDelegate.translateForDismiss = 100\n```\n\nProperty `tapAroundToDismissEnabled` enables dismissal by tapping parent controller. Default is `true`:\n\n```swift\ntransitionDelegate.tapAroundToDismissEnabled = true\n```\n\n### Corner Radius\n\nProperty `cornerRadius` for customize corner radius of controller's view. Default is `10`:\n\n```swift\ntransitionDelegate.cornerRadius = 10\n```\n\n### Haptic\n\nProperty `hapticMoments` allow add taptic feedback for some moments. Default is `.willDismissIfRelease`:\n\n```swift\ntransitionDelegate.hapticMoments = [.willPresent, .willDismiss]\n```\n\n### Snapshots\n\nThe project uses a snapshot of the screen in order to avoid compatibility and customisation issues. Before controller presentation, a snapshot of the parent view is made, and size and position are changed for the snapshot. Sometimes you will need to update the screenshot of the parent view, for that use static func:\n\n```swift\nSPStorkController.updatePresentingController(modal: controller)\n```\n\nand pass the controller, which is modal and uses `SPStorkTransitioningDelegate`.\n\nIf the parent controller scrollings and you try to show `SPStorkController`, you will see how it froze, and in a second its final position is updated. I recommend before present `SPStorkController`  stop scrolling force:\n\n```swift \nscrollView.setContentOffset(self.contentOffset, animated: false)\n```\n\n### Navigation Bar\n\nYou may want to add a navigation bar to your modal controller. Since it became impossible to change or customize the native controller in swift 4 (I couldn\u2019t even find a way to change the height of the bar), I had to recreate navigation bar from the ground up. Visually it looks real, but it doesn\u2019t execute the necessary functions:\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\nimport SPFakeBar\n\nclass ModalController: UIViewController {\n    \n    let navBar = SPFakeBarView(style: .stork)\n        \n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n\n        self.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.white\n\n        self.navBar.titleLabel.text = \"Title\"\n        self.navBar.leftButton.setTitle(\"Cancel\", for: .normal)\n        self.navBar.leftButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(self.dismissAction), for: .touchUpInside)\n\n        self.view.addSubview(self.navBar)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou only need to add a navigation bar to the main view, it will automatically layout. Use style `.stork` in init of `SPFakeBarView`. Here is visual preview with Navigation Bar and without it:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/ivanvorobei/SPStorkController/blob/master/Resources/Navigation%20Bar.jpg\"/>\n\nTo use it, you need to install [SPFakeBar](https://github.com/ivanvorobei/SPFakeBar) pod: \n\n```ruby\npod 'SPFakeBar'\n```\n\n### Working with UIScrollView\n\nIf you use `UIScrollView` (or UITableView & UICollectionView) on controller, I recommend making it more interactive. When scrolling reaches the top position, the controller will interactively drag down, simulating a closing animation. Also available close controller by drag down on `UIScrollView`. To do this, set the delegate and in the function `scrollViewDidScroll` call:\n\n```swift\nfunc scrollViewDidScroll(_ scrollView: UIScrollView) {\n    SPStorkController.scrollViewDidScroll(scrollView)\n}\n```\n\n### Working with UITableView & UICollectionView\n\nWorking with a collections classes is not difficult. In the `Example` folder you can find an implementation. However, I will give a couple of tips for making the table look better.\n\nFirstly, if you use `SPFakeBarView`, don't forget to set top insets for content & scroll indicator. Also, I recommend setting bottom insets (it optional):\n\n```swift\ntableView.contentInset.top = self.navBar.height\ntableView.scrollIndicatorInsets.top = self.navBar.height\n```\n\nPlease, also use `SPStorkController.scrollViewDidScroll` function in scroll delegate for more interactiveness with your collection or table view.\n\n### Confirm before dismiss\n\nFor confirm closing by swipe, tap around, close button and indicator use `SPStorkControllerConfirmDelegate`. Implenet protocol:\n\n```swift\n@objc public protocol SPStorkControllerConfirmDelegate: class {\n    \n    var needConfirm: Bool { get }\n    \n    func confirm(_ completion: @escaping (_ isConfirmed: Bool)->())\n}\n```\n\nand set `confirmDelegate` property to object, which protocol impleneted. Function `confirm` call if `needConfirm` return true. Pass `isConfirmed` with result. Best options use `UIAlertController` with `.actionSheet` style for confirmation.\n\nIf you use custom buttons, in the target use this code:\n\n```swift\nSPStorkController.dismissWithConfirmation(controller: self, completion: nil)\n```\n\nIt call `confirm` func and check result of confirmation. See example project for more details.\n\n### Delegate\n\nYou can check events by implement `SPStorkControllerDelegate` and set delegate for `transitionDelegate`:\n\n```swift\ntransitionDelegate.storkDelegate = self\n```\n\nDelagate has this functions: \n\n```swift\nprotocol SPStorkControllerDelegate: class {\n    \n    optional func didDismissStorkBySwipe()\n    \n    optional func didDismissStorkByTap()\n}\n```\n\n### Storyboard\n\nIf need using `SPStorkController` with storyboard, set class `SPStorkSegue` for transition setting in storyboard file. I will give the class code so that you understand what it does:\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\n\nclass SPStorkSegue: UIStoryboardSegue {\n    \n    public var transitioningDelegate: SPStorkTransitioningDelegate?\n    \n    override func perform() {\n        transitioningDelegate = transitioningDelegate ?? SPStorkTransitioningDelegate()\n        destination.transitioningDelegate = transitioningDelegate\n        destination.modalPresentationStyle = .custom\n        super.perform()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOpen your storyboard, choose transition and open right menu. Open `Attributes Inspector` and in Class section insert `SPStorkSegue`.\n\n### Modal presentation of other controller\n\nIf you want to present modal controller on `SPStorkController`, please set:\n\n```swift\ncontroller.modalPresentationStyle = .custom\n```\n\nIt\u2019s needed for correct presentation and dismissal of all modal controllers.\n\n## Sheets in iOS 13\n\nApple present in `WWDC 2019` new modal presentation style - `Sheets`. It ready use Support interactive dismiss and work with navigations bars. Available since iOS 13. I will add more information when I study this in more detail. You can see presentation [here](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/224/).\n\n<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/224/\" target=\"_blank\"><img align=\"center\" src=\"https://github.com/ivanvorobei/SPStorkController/blob/master/Resources/Sheets.png\"/></a>\n\n## Other Projects\n\nI love being helpful.

Please read [the release/migration notes](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts/releases/tag/v3.0.0). \n### Another heads up: ChartsRealm is now in a [separate repo](https://github.com/danielgindi/ChartsRealm). Pods is also now `Charts` and `ChartsRealm`, instead of ~`Charts/Core`~ and ~`Charts/Realm`~\n### One more heads up: As Swift evolves, if you are not using the latest Swift compiler, you shouldn't check out the master branch. Instead, you should go to the release page and pick up whatever suits you.\n\n* Xcode 11 / Swift 5 (master branch)\n* iOS >= 8.0 (Use as an **Embedded** Framework)\n* tvOS >= 9.0\n* macOS >= 10.11\n\nOkay so there's this beautiful library called [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) by [Philipp Jahoda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philippjahoda) which has become very popular amongst Android developers, but there was no decent solution to create charts for iOS.\n\nI've chosen to write it in `Swift` as it can be highly optimized by the compiler, and can be used in both `Swift` and `ObjC` project. The demo project is written in `ObjC` to demonstrate how it works.\n\n**An amazing feature** of this library now, for Android, iOS, tvOS and macOS, is the time it saves you when developing for both platforms, as the learning curve is singleton- it happens only once, and the code stays very similar so developers don't have to go around and re-invent the app to produce the same output with a different library. (And that's not even considering the fact that there's not really another good choice out there currently...)\n\n## Having trouble running the demo?\n\n* `ChartsDemo/ChartsDemo.xcodeproj` is the demo project for iOS/tvOS\n* `ChartsDemo-OSX/ChartsDemo-OSX.xcodeproj` is the demo project for macOS\n* Make sure you are running a supported version of Xcode.\n  * Usually it is specified here a few lines above.\n  * In most cases it will be the latest Xcode version.\n* Make sure that your project supports Swift 5.0\n* Optional: Run `carthage checkout` in the project folder, to fetch dependencies (i.e testing dependencies).\n  * If you don't have Carthage - you can get it [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases).\n\n\n## Usage\n\nIn order to correctly compile:\n\n1. Drag the `Charts.xcodeproj` to your project  \n2. Go to your target's settings, hit the \"+\" under the \"Embedded Binaries\" section, and select the Charts.framework  \n3. `@import Charts`  \n4.  When using Swift in an ObjC project:\n   - You need to import your Bridging Header. Usually it is \"*YourProject-Swift.h*\", so in ChartsDemo it's \"*ChartsDemo-Swift.h*\". Do not try to actually include \"*ChartsDemo-Swift.h*\" in your project :-)\n   - (Xcode 8.1 and earlier) Under \"Build Options\", mark \"Embedded Content Contains Swift Code\"\n   - (Xcode 8.2+) Under \"Build Options\", mark \"Always Embed Swift Standard Libraries\"\n5. When using [Realm.io](https://realm.io/):\n   - Note that the Realm framework is not linked with Charts - it is only there for *optional* bindings. Which means that you need to have the framework in your project, and in a compatible version to whatever is compiled with Charts. We will do our best to always compile against the latest version.\n   - You'll need to add `ChartsRealm` as a dependency too.\n\n## 3rd party tutorials\n#### Video tutorials\n\n* [Chart in Swift - Setting Up a Basic Line Chart Using iOS Charts(Alex Nagy)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWhwe_tLNE8&list=PL_csAAO9PQ8bjzg-wxEff1Fr0Y5W1hrum&index=5)\n* [Charts Framework in SwiftUI - Bar Chart (Stewart Lynch)](https://youtu.be/csd7pyfEXgw)\n\n#### Blog posts\n* [Using Realm and Charts with Swift 3 in iOS 10 (Sami Korpela)](https://medium.com/@skoli/using-realm-and-charts-with-swift-3-in-ios-10-40c42e3838c0#.2gyymwfh8)\n* [Creating a Line Chart in Swift 3 and iOS 10 (Osian Smith)](https://medium.com/@OsianSmith/creating-a-line-chart-in-swift-3-and-ios-10-2f647c95392e)\n* [Beginning Set-up and Example Using Charts with Swift 3](https://github.com/annalizhaz/ChartsForSwiftBasic)\n* [Creating a Radar Chart in Swift (David Piper)](https://medium.com/@HeyDaveTheDev/creating-a-radar-chart-in-swift-5791afcf92f0)\n* [Plotting in IOS using Charts framework with SwiftUI (Evgeny Basisty)](https://medium.com/@zzzzbh/plotting-in-ios-using-charts-framework-with-swiftui-222034a2bea6)\n*   [Set Up a Basic Bar Chart Using iOS-Charts (Penny Huang)](https://medium.com/@penny-huang/swift-setting-up-a-basic-bar-chart-using-ios-charts-afd6aad96ac)\n*  [iOS-Charts Tutorial: Highlight Selected Value With a Custom Marker (Penny Huang)](https://medium.com/@penny-huang/swift-ios-charts-tutorial-highlight-selected-value-with-a-custom-marker-30ccbf92aa1b)\n\nWant your tutorial to show here?

All the information captured is available in the App Center portal for you to analyze the data.\n\n2. **App Center Crashes**: App Center Crashes will automatically generate a crash log every time your app crashes. The log is first written to the device's storage and when the user starts the app again, the crash report will be sent to App Center. Collecting crashes works for both beta and live apps, i.e. those submitted to the App Store. Crash logs contain valuable information for you to help fix the crash.\n\n3. **App Center Distribute**: App Center Distribute lets your users install a new version of the app when you distribute it with App Center. With a new version of the app available, the SDK will present an update dialog to the users to either download or postpone the new version. Once they choose to update, the SDK will start to update your application. This feature is automatically disabled on versions of your app deployed to the Apple App Store. **Not available for macOS and tvOS*.\n\n## 1. Get started\n\nIt is super easy to use App Center. Have a look at our [get started documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/sdk/getting-started/ios) and onboard your app within minutes. Our [detailed documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/sdk/) is available as well.\n\n## 2. Contributing\n\nWe are looking forward to your contributions via pull requests.\n\n### 2.1 Code of Conduct\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.\n\n### 2.2 Contributor License\n\nYou must sign a [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.microsoft.com/) before submitting your pull request. To complete the Contributor License Agreement (CLA), you will need to submit a request via the [form](https://cla.microsoft.com/) and then electronically sign the CLA when you receive the email containing the link to the document. You need to sign the CLA only once to cover submission to any Microsoft OSS project. \n\n## 3. Contact\n\n### 3.1 Support\n\nApp Center SDK support is provided directly within the App Center portal. Any time you need help, just log in to [App Center](https://appcenter.ms), then click the blue chat button in the lower-right corner of any page and our dedicated support team will respond to your questions and feedback.

With the **[Vision Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision)**, it's much easier to detect faces in real time \ud83d\ude03\n\nTry it out with real time face detection on your iPhone! \ud83d\udcf1\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Weijay/AppleFaceDetection/blob/master/resources/VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest.png\" width=\"250\" height=\"400\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/Weijay/AppleFaceDetection/blob/master/resources/VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest.png\" width=\"250\" height=\"400\"/>  <img src=\"https://github.com/Weijay/AppleFaceDetection/blob/master/resources/faceRecognition.gif\" />\n\nYou can find out the differences between `CIDetector` and `Vison Framework` down below.\n\n[Moving From Voila-Jones to Deep Learning](https://machinelearning.apple.com/2017/11/16/face-detection.html)\n\n\n---\n\n## Details\n\nSpecify the `VNRequest` for face recognition, either `VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest` or `VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest`.\n\n```swift\nprivate var requests = [VNRequest]() // you can do mutiple requests at the same time\n\nvar faceDetectionRequest: VNRequest!\n@IBAction func UpdateDetectionType(_ sender: UISegmentedControl) {\n    // use segmentedControl to switch over VNRequest\n    faceDetectionRequest = sender.selectedSegmentIndex == 0 ? VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest(completionHandler: handleFaces) : VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest(completionHandler: handleFaceLandmarks) \n}\n\n```\n\nPerform the requests every single frame. The image comes from camera via `captureOutput(_:didOutput:from:)`, see [AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcapturevideodataoutputsamplebufferdelegate/1385775-captureoutput) \n\n```swift\nfunc captureOutput(_ output: AVCaptureOutput, didOutput sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, from connection: AVCaptureConnection) {\n    guard let pixelBuffer = CMSampleBufferGetImageBuffer(sampleBuffer),\n        let exifOrientation = CGImagePropertyOrientation(rawValue: exifOrientationFromDeviceOrientation()) else { return }\n    var requestOptions: [VNImageOption : Any] = [:]\n\n    if let cameraIntrinsicData = CMGetAttachment(sampleBuffer, kCMSampleBufferAttachmentKey_CameraIntrinsicMatrix, nil) {\n      requestOptions = [.cameraIntrinsics : cameraIntrinsicData]\n    }\n    \n    // perform image request for face recognition\n    let imageRequestHandler = VNImageRequestHandler(cvPixelBuffer: pixelBuffer, orientation: exifOrientation, options: requestOptions)\n\n    do {\n      try imageRequestHandler.perform(self.requests)\n    }\n\n    catch {\n      print(error)\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nHandle the return of your request, `VNRequestCompletionHandler`.  \n- `handleFaces` for `VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest`\n- `handleFaceLandmarks` for `VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest`\n\nthen you will get the result from the request, which are `VNFaceObservation`s. That's all you got from the **Vision API**\n\n```swift\nfunc handleFaces(request: VNRequest, error: Error?) {\n    DispatchQueue.main.async {\n        //perform all the UI updates on the main queue\n        guard let results = request.results as? [VNFaceObservation] else { return }\n        print(\"face count = \\(results.count) \")\n        self.previewView.removeMask()\n\n        for face in results {\n            self.previewView.drawFaceboundingBox(face: face)\n        }\n    }\n}\n    \nfunc handleFaceLandmarks(request: VNRequest, error: Error?) {\n    DispatchQueue.main.async {\n        //perform all the UI updates on the main queue\n        guard let results = request.results as? [VNFaceObservation] else { return }\n        self.previewView.removeMask()\n        for face in results {\n            self.previewView.drawFaceWithLandmarks(face: face)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nLastly, **DRAW** corresponding location on the screen!\n<Hint: [UIBezierPath](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uibezierpath) to draw line for landmarks>\n\n```swift\nfunc drawFaceboundingBox(face : VNFaceObservation) {\n    // The coordinates are normalized to the dimensions of the processed image, with the origin at the image's lower-left corner.\n\n    let transform = CGAffineTransform(scaleX: 1, y: -1).translatedBy(x: 0, y: -frame.height)\n\n    let scale = CGAffineTransform.identity.scaledBy(x: frame.width, y: frame.height)\n\n    let facebounds = face.boundingBox.applying(scale).applying(transform)\n\n    _ = createLayer(in: facebounds)\n\n}\n\n// Create a new layer drawing the bounding box\nprivate func createLayer(in rect: CGRect) -> CAShapeLayer {\n\n    let mask = CAShapeLayer()\n    mask.frame = rect\n    mask.cornerRadius = 10\n    mask.opacity = 0.75\n    mask.borderColor = UIColor.yellow.cgColor\n    mask.borderWidth = 2.0\n\n    maskLayer.append(mask)\n    layer.insertSublayer(mask, at: 1)\n\n    return mask\n}\n\n```\n"

Houston supports only the legacy binary APNs protocol, which as of March 31, 2021 is no longer supported. Please migrate to an alternative library, such as [Apnotic](https://github.com/ostinelli/apnotic) to send push notifications using the new APNs2 protocol. \n\nPush Notifications don't have to be difficult.\n\nHouston is a simple gem for sending Apple Push Notifications. Pass your credentials, construct your message, and send it.\n\nIn a production application, you will probably want to schedule or queue notifications into a background job. Whether you're using [queue_classic](https://github.com/ryandotsmith/queue_classic), [resque](https://github.com/resque/resque), or rolling you own infrastructure, integrating Houston couldn't be simpler.\n\n> Houston is named for [Houston, TX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston), the metonymical home of [NASA's Johnson Space Center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson_Space_Center), as in _Houston, We Have Liftoff!_.\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ gem install houston\n\n## Usage\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'houston'\n\n# Environment variables are automatically read, or can be overridden by any specified options. You can also\n# conveniently use `Houston::Client.development` or `Houston::Client.production`.\nAPN = Houston::Client.development\nAPN.certificate = File.read('/path/to/apple_push_notification.pem')\n\n# An example of the token sent back when a device registers for notifications\ntoken = '<ce8be627 2e43e855 16033e24 b4c28922 0eeda487 9c477160 b2545e95 b68b5969>'\n\n# Create a notification that alerts a message to the user, plays a sound, and sets the badge on the app\nnotification = Houston::Notification.new(device: token)\nnotification.alert = 'Hello, World!'\n\n# Notifications can also change the badge count, have a custom sound, have a category identifier, indicate available Newsstand content, or pass along arbitrary data.\nnotification.badge = 57\nnotification.sound = 'sosumi.aiff'\nnotification.category = 'INVITE_CATEGORY'\nnotification.content_available = true\nnotification.mutable_content = true\nnotification.custom_data = { foo: 'bar' }\nnotification.url_args = %w[boarding A998]\nnotification.thread_id = 'notify-team-ios'\n\n# And... sent! That's all it takes.\nAPN.push(notification)\n```\n\nTo generate a `.pem` file, it is recommended to use [fastlane pem](https://fastlane.tools/pem), which completely automates the process of creating the certificate.\n\n## Configuration\n\nHouston will attempt to load configuration data from environment variables, if they're present. The following variables will be used.\n\n| Environment Variable | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `APN_GATEWAY_URI` | The base URI for the APNS service to use. If left blank, will use the default APNS Production Gateway URI. |\n| `APN_FEEDBACK_URI` | The base URI for the APNS feedback service to use. If left blank, will use the default APNS Production Feedback URI. |\n| `APN_CERTIFICATE` | The file path to a valid APNS push certificate in `.pem` format (see \"[Converting Your Certificate](#converting-your-certificate)\" below). |\n| `APN_CERTIFICATE_DATA` | The contents of a valid APNS push certificate in `.pem` format (see \"[Converting Your Certificate](#converting-your-certificate)\" below); used in lieu of `APN_CERTIFICATE` if that variable is not provided. |\n| `APN_CERTIFICATE_PASSPHRASE` | If the APNS certificate is protected by a passphrase, provide this variable to use when decrypting it. |\n| `APN_TIMEOUT` | The timeout used when communicating with APNS. If not provided, the default of 0.5 seconds is used. |\n\n### Error Handling\n\nIf an error occurs when sending a particular notification, its `error` attribute will be populated:\n\n```ruby\nputs \"Error: #{notification.error}.\" if notification.error\n```\n\n### Silent Notifications\n\nTo send a silent push notification, set `sound` to an empty string (`''`):\n\n```ruby\nHouston::Notification.new(sound: '', content_available: true)\n```\n\n### Mutable Notifications\n\nTo send a mutable push notification (supported by iOS 10+), set `mutable_content` to `true`:\n\n```ruby\nHouston::Notification.new(mutable_content: true)\n```\n\n### Persistent Connections\n\nIf you want to manage your own persistent connection to Apple push services, such as for background workers, here's how to do it:\n\n```ruby\ncertificate = File.read('/path/to/apple_push_notification.pem')\npassphrase = '...'\nconnection = Houston::Connection.new(Houston::APPLE_DEVELOPMENT_GATEWAY_URI, certificate, passphrase)\nconnection.open\n\nnotification = Houston::Notification.new(device: token)\nnotification.alert = 'Hello, World!'\nconnection.write(notification.message)\n\nconnection.close\n```\n\n### Feedback Service\n\nApple provides a feedback service to query for unregistered device tokens, these are devices that have failed to receive a push notification and should be removed from your application. You should periodically query for and remove these devices, Apple audits providers to ensure they are removing unregistered devices. To obtain the list of unregistered device tokens:\n\n```ruby\nHouston::Client.development.devices\n```\n\nIn practice, you'll use a reference to instance of the APN object you create (see the Usage section). Here's a rake job that marks device tokens as invalid based on the feedback service from Apple. This example assumes devices are tracked in a model called Device (i.e. `User.devices`).\n\nIn `lib/tasks/notifications.rake`:\n\n```ruby\nnamespace :notifications do\n  task device_token_feedback: [:environment] do\n    APN.unregistered_devices.each do |device_hash|\n      # Format: { token: token, timestamp: timestamp }\n      device = Device.find_by(token: device_hash[:token])\n      next unless device.present?\n      # Remove device token\n      device.update_attribute(:device_token, nil)\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\n## Versioning\n\nHouston 2.0 supports the new [enhanced notification format](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/CommunicatingWIthAPS.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH101-SW4). Support for the legacy notification format is available in 1.x releases.\n\n## Command Line Tool\n\nHouston also comes with the `apn` binary, which provides a convenient way to test notifications from the command line.\n\n    $ apn push \"<token>\" -c /path/to/apple_push_notification.pem -m \"Hello from the command line! \"\n\n## Enabling Push Notifications on iOS\n\n### Objective-C\n\n```objective-c\n// AppDelegate.m\n\n- (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(UIApplication *)application {\n  // ...\n\n  [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:(UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert | UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge | UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound)];\n}\n\n- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application\ndidRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken\n{\n    NSLog(@\"application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken: %@\", deviceToken);\n\n    // Register the device token with a webservice\n}\n\n- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application\ndidFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError *)error\n{\n    NSLog(@\"Error: %@\", error);\n}\n```\n\n### Swift\n```swift\n// AppDelegate.swift\n\nfunc application(_ application: UIApplication, willFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil) -> Bool {\n    application.registerForRemoteNotifications()\n    return true\n}\n\nfunc application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {\n    // Register the device token with a webservice\n}\n\nfunc application(_ application: UIApplication, didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError error: Error) {\n    print(\"error \\(error)\")\n}\n```\n\n## Converting Your Certificate\n\n> These instructions come from the [APN on Rails](https://github.com/PRX/apn_on_rails) project, which is another great option for sending push notifications.\n\nOnce you have the certificate from Apple for your application, export your key\nand the apple certificate as p12 files. Here is a quick walkthrough on how to do this:\n\n1. Click the disclosure arrow next to your certificate in Keychain Access and select the certificate and the key.\n2. Right click and choose `Export 2 items\u2026`.\n3. Choose the p12 format from the drop down and name it `cert.p12`.\n\nNow convert the p12 file to a pem file:\n\n**Unencrypted private key (do not store this certificate in version control)**\n\n    $ openssl pkcs12 -in cert.p12 -out apple_push_notification.pem -nodes -clcerts\n\n**Encrypted private key**\n\n    $ openssl pkcs12 -in cert.p12 -out apple_push_notification.pem -aes256 -clcerts\n\nYou'll have to specify the password in the `APN_CERTIFICATE_PASSPHRASE` environment variable if you use the encrypted option.\n\n## License\n\nHouston is available under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more info.\n"

It looks similar to the Apple Calendar app out-of-the-box, while allowing customization when needed. CalendarKit is composed of multiple modules which can be used together or independently.\n\n## Tutorials\n- [Create iOS Calendar App in Swift with CalendarKit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC4XxmExqFA)\n\n## Need Help?\nIf you have a **programming question** about how to use CalendarKit in your application, ask it on StackOverflow with the [CalendarKit](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/calendarkit) tag. Check out the [Sample App](https://github.com/richardtop/CalendarApp) for reference.\n\nPlease, use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/richardtop/CalendarKit/issues) only for reporting a bug or requesting a new feature.\n\n\n## Examples\n[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi-Qqp9BaAs)\n\n[Sample App](https://github.com/richardtop/CalendarApp)\n\nTo try CalendarKit with CocoaPods issue the following command in the Terminal:\n```ruby\npod try CalendarKit\n```\n\n## Installation\nCalendarKit can be installed with Swift Package Manager or with CocoaPods.\n### Swift Package Manager (Xcode 12 or higher)\n\nThe preferred way of installing CalendarKit is via the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).\n\n1. In Xcode, open your project and navigate to **File** \u2192 **Swift Packages** \u2192 **Add Package Dependency...**\n2. Paste the repository URL (`https://github.com/richardtop/CalendarKit.git`) and click **Next**.\n3. For **Rules**, select **Version (Up to Next Major)** and click **Next**.\n4. Click **Finish**.\n\n[Adding Package Dependencies to Your App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app)\n\n### CocoaPods\n\nTo install it, add the following line to your Podfile:\n\n```ruby\npod 'CalendarKit'\n```\n[Adding Pods to an Xcode project](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html)\n\n## Usage\n1. Subclass `DayViewController`\n2. Implement `EventDataSource` protocol to show events.\n\nCalendarKit requires `EventDataSource` to return an array of objects conforming to `EventDescriptor` protocol, specifying all the information needed to display a particular event. You're free to use a default `Event` class as a model or create your own class conforming to the `EventDescriptor` protocol.\n\n```swift\n// Return an array of EventDescriptors for particular date\noverride func eventsForDate(_ date: Date) -> [EventDescriptor] {\n  var models = myAppEventStore.getEventsForDate(date) // Get events (models) from the storage / API\n\n  var events = [Event]()\n\n  for model in models {\n      // Create new EventView\n      let event = Event()\n      // Specify DateInterval\n      event.dateInterval = DateInterval(start: model.startDate, end: model.endDate)\n      // Add info: event title, subtitle, location to the array of Strings\n      var info = [model.title, model.location]\n      info.append(\"\\(datePeriod.beginning!.format(with: \"HH:mm\")) - \\(datePeriod.end!.format(with: \"HH:mm\"))\")\n      // Set \"text\" value of event by formatting all the information needed for display\n      event.text = info.reduce(\"\", {$0 + $1 + \"\\n\"})\n      events.append(event)\n  }\n  return events\n}\n```\nAfter receiving an array of events for a particular day, CalendarKit will handle view layout and display.\n\n### Usage\nTo respond to the user input, override mehtods of `DayViewDelegate`, for example:\n\n```swift\noverride func dayViewDidSelectEventView(_ eventView: EventView) {\n  print(\"Event has been selected: \\(eventview.data)\")\n}\n\noverride func dayViewDidLongPressEventView(_ eventView: EventView) {\n  print(\"Event has been longPressed: \\(eventView.data)\")\n}\n```\n\n## Localization\nCalendarKit supports localization and uses iOS default locale to display month and day names. First day of the week is also selected according to the iOS locale.\n\n<img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8013017/22315567/8ba5f9c2-e378-11e6-860d-b94e87a2a45c.PNG\" alt=\"German\" width=\"320\"><img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8013017/22315600/c87e826a-e378-11e6-9280-732982b42077.PNG\" alt=\"Norwegian\" width=\"320\">\n\n\n## Styles\nBy default, CalendarKit looks similar to the Apple Calendar app and fully supports Dark Mode. If needed, CalendarKit's look can be easily customized. Steps to apply a custom style are as follows:\n\n1. Create a new `CalendarStyle` object (or copy existing one)\n2. Change style by updating the properties.\n3. Invoke `updateStyle` method with the new `CalendarStyle`.\n\n\n```Swift\nlet style = CalendarStyle()\nstyle.backgroundColor = UIColor.black\ndayView.updateStyle(style)\n```\n<img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8013017/22717896/a2a6c6f2-edae-11e6-8ac3-d9add3d61fb9.png\" alt=\"Light theme\" width=\"320\"> <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8013017/69188457-3dfe6880-0b25-11ea-9674-39b9f3c1cd00.png\" alt=\"Dark theme\" width=\"320\"> \n\n\n## Requirements\n\n- iOS 10.0+, macOS (Catalyst) 10.15+\n- Swift 4+ (Library is written in Swift 5)\n\n## Contributing\nThe list of features currently in development can be viewed on the [issues](https://github.com/richardtop/CalendarKit/issues) page.\n\nBefore contributing, please review [guidelines and code style](https://github.com/richardtop/CalendarKit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n\n## Author\n\nRichard Topchii\n\n\n## License\n\n**CalendarKit** is available under the MIT license.

  "readme_contents": "# AppleWatchFaces\n**Design your own watch faces for the apple watch. They are not *real* watch faces, but a watchOS app running on the watch that tells you the time.**\n\n![APPLEWATCHFACES USAGE](docs/AppleWatchFacesQuickDemo.gif)\n\nThe iOS app allows for the user to create **their own** watch faces by choosing from hands and adding in common watch face \"indicators\" like rings of circles or a little date label.  Additionally, you can add a new face to your list and choose from pre-defined \"themes\" of colors or indicators/hands from the default watch faces. \n\nTo see what type of default faces it comes with, browse the [thumbnails folder](https://github.com/orff/AppleWatchFaces/tree/master/docs/faceThumbs), here are some examples:\n\n<img src=\"docs/faceThumbs/0094F400-E9D6-46F6-9E88-263015C08B7C.jpg\" width=\"24%\"></img>\n<img src=\"docs/faceThumbs/2554B281-CE68-4675-B644-C93A1917D59B.jpg\" width=\"24%\"></img>\n<img src=\"docs/faceThumbs/B951692A-EC5D-4CC7-96E0-A75215EE1529.jpg\" width=\"24%\"></img>\n<img src=\"docs/faceThumbs/CFC250CB-AFEE-40A1-9C10-CBD304449F57.jpg\" width=\"24%\"></img>\n<img src=\"docs/faceThumbs/4D503860-393E-4DEA-B0AC-CBFA02D33667.jpg\" width=\"24%\"></img>\n<img src=\"docs/faceThumbs/A74CDB68-4263-4E3B-B87E-EAB77D2C25CA.jpg\" width=\"24%\"></img>\n<img src=\"docs/faceThumbs/E3B2EAB9-5ABA-4D0D-A1DC-11D3673B36FD.jpg\" width=\"24%\"></img>\n<img src=\"docs/faceThumbs/DD6D0D82-3692-4161-9B36-5E7828CBC2EA.jpg\" width=\"24%\"></img>\n<img src=\"docs/faceThumbs/08F9E48F-55D8-4566-BF96-1C87273F13E7.jpg\" width=\"24%\"></img>\n<img src=\"docs/faceThumbs/4CE3C2CA-C77D-4A00-8B9D-3319DD01EE80.jpg\" width=\"24%\"></img>\n<img src=\"docs/faceThumbs/DB31731B-5D3F-4193-930D-822AE64CF622.jpg\" width=\"24%\"></img>\n<img src=\"docs/faceThumbs/A0B82702-2781-43C8-BC93-EBFA5277A2BC.jpg\" width=\"24%\"></img>\n<img src=\"docs/faceThumbs/5BEB5F08-B06B-4CBD-A587-963C27F3E4FC.jpg\" width=\"24%\"></img>\n<img src=\"docs/faceThumbs/067BC615-AF45-482D-AE6F-D58C3E347206.jpg\" width=\"24%\"></img>\n<img src=\"docs/faceThumbs/613635D1-63D0-4D4B-9B1E-8BFEE57F34C2.jpg\" width=\"24%\"></img>\n<img src=\"docs/faceThumbs/18A6F50D-E136-4F74-B009-C50CDA0BA344.jpg\" width=\"24%\"></img>\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n1. **Does this work on WatchOS6 ?** \n\nYes, working well now on public releases ( including hiding the apple digital time )\n\n2. **Can I download this from the app store ?**\n\nAt this time, Apple is not ready for developer created watch faces -- **Typical response from Apple if you submit an iOS app that has a watch face:**\n\nGuideline 4.2.4 - Design - Minimum Functionality\n\nWe continued to notice that your Apple Watch app is primarily a clock app with time-telling functionality, which provides a lower quality user experience than Apple users expect. Specifically, users must launch the app or swipe through glances to see the time.\n\nThe native clock app already allows users to customize how time is displayed on their devices and offers the best possible time-telling experience. Users are able to switch colors, add more functionality and complications on a watch face such as an alarm, the weather, stocks, activity rings, moon phases, or sunrises and sunsets. Users also have the ability to tap on certain complications to get more information from their corresponding apps.\n\nWe encourage you to review your Apple Watch app concept and incorporate different content and features that are in compliance with the [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/), as well as the [watchOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/watchos/human-interface-guidelines/). If you want to show the time in your Apple Watch app, you may use the specialized Date Labels to display time-related values on Apple Watch.\n\n3. **Can I join your testFlight and help you beta test?**\n\nYes, I am accepting testers for beta testing.  DM an email to [@orffy](https://twitter.com/orffy) to send a testFlight invite.   It does not need to be an appleID email, just any email you can check. Someone will notify you on twitter when you have been invited, then check the email provided for a link from apple testFlight.  Follow the instructions in that email.\n\n4. **How do I get this on my phone / watch?**\n\nJoin the beta test or follow the installation instructions below to compile from the source and you can *side load* this application onto your phone and watch.\n\n5. **How can I create my own watch hands?**\n\n  Currently the watch hands are using UIKit paths and has support for PNGs.  See the example **SecondHandTypes.SecondHandTypeFancyRed** in Shared/Nodes/MinuteHand.swift.  The code will attempt to tint the PNG pixels with the chosen hand color.  White pixels will colorize to the chosen color, and black will not tint at all.  Colors in between will blend.  Import your PNG assets into the /Shared/Media.xcassets folder. \n  \n  There has been many requests for the app to allow adding PNG hands inside the app.  I am investigating this for a future build.\n  \n6. **Can I use my own background images from my phone in the app?**\n\n  Yes, tap on the camera icon in the background color picker to pull an image off the phone's camera or gallery.\n\n7. **How can I add my own images for use as a background in the watch faces ?**\n\n    1. Crop the image to a square at approximately 312x390 pixels ( 72 ppi )\n    2. Drop it into the **/Shared/Resources/Materials** folder ( add to the project )\n    3. Add it into the /Shared/AppUISettings file materialFiles array\n    \n8. **Which versions of apple watches does this work with ?**\n\nAny watchOS that can run spriteKit should be fine. Tested with watchOS 5 on a device and 4.2/4.3 in the simulator.\n\n9. **Are you planning to do complications ?**\n\nCurrently the app supports date/time and battery \"decorators\" that do their best to stay out of the way of the other items that make up the watch face rings.\n\n10. **Are all the designs round  ?**\n\nIn [PR 11](https://github.com/orff/AppleWatchFaces/pull/11) support for rounded rectangle designs was added. It it not a perfect solution for watch designs:  While it does postiion the items along a rounded rectangle path, it evenly distributes them which does not perfectly line up with the watch hands.  Also box / square shapes look weird just rotated to face the center vs. a \"true\" watch design which would mask the edges.  \n\n11. **What about digital clocks  ?**\n\nIn [PR 18](https://github.com/orff/AppleWatchFaces/pull/18) added support for date/time labels as \"indicators\" in the iOS editor app.  Add them and edit settings appropriately.\n\n12. **Can I back up, edit, or restore my faces?**\n\nSee Back-Up / Restore in the Usage section below.\n\n## Installation / Side Load\n\nSome users are having limited success installing the ad-hoc IPA file in the [releases](https://github.com/orff/AppleWatchFaces/releases) using tools like impactor and app DBPro.  For best results, sign up as an Apple developer and side-load:\n\n1. Install [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) on your mac\n\n1. Open a Terminal instance and go to your working directory\n\n1. Do \n<code>git clone https://github.com/orff/AppleWatchFaces.git</code>\n\n1. Navigate to the \"AppleWatchFaces\" folder in your working directory\n\n1. Open AppleWatchFaces.xcodeproj in Xcode\n\n1. Run on your device:\n1. Make sure you have an Apple developer account\n1. Select your development team under the `Signing` area for each target (`AppleWatchFaces`, `face`, and `face (notifications)`)\n1. Change the `Bundle Identifier` for each of the above targets to something unique. For example, `AppleWatchFaces` uses `com.mikehill.applewatchfaces`, so change that to something like `com.YOUR_USERNAME.applewatchfaces` \n1. *important note:* Bundle identifiers for watch extensions are really specific.  `face` uses `com.mikehill.applewatchfaces.watchkit`  & `face (notifications)` uses `com.mikehill.applewatchfaces.watchkit.extension`\n1. Select the `face` scheme in the top left corner with your devices selected and run.\n\nIf you are still having issues, please check out a [sideloading tutorial](http://osxdaily.com/2016/01/12/howto-sideload-apps-iphone-ipad-xcode/) on OSXDaily.\n\n## Usage\n\n### iOS App\n\n1. The main view is for previewing all the faces and deciding if you want to edit one of the them.  You can create a new one with the *create* button or tap *edit* to re-order or delete.  Tapping *send all to watch* will send all current designs to the watch and go to the first one.\n1. On the editor view, you can modify settings for that watch face, like the colors, hands, or indicators ( the parts that make up the face like the shapes and numbers that the hands point to ).  \n1. On the editor view, dragging left and right to see the face in different times. go to Swipe up to preview this design on the watch: this the same as the tapping the watch button in the toolbar.\n1. Tap the + and - buttons to swith to other faces in the main face list.\n1. On the indicators view you can edit the shapes and numbers that make up the face backgrounds.  The designs are rendered on the watch as shapes like circle or squares and text numbers that are *rings* from the outside to the inside of the watch face.  By editing the list of shapes and text items and *empty space* items, you can change the design of the items in the face and see in the preview watch on the top.\n\n![APPLEWATCHFACES INDICATORS](docs/AppleWatchFaceIndicators.gif)\n\n6. You can also just choose from pre-defined *color themes* or *indicator themes* which will override current color or parts with known good settings\n\n![APPLEWATCHFACES THEMES](docs/AppleWatchFacesThemes.gif)\n\n7. Undo / Redo if you make a mistake.  \n8. Going back will lock in these settings in the main list and regenerate the thumbnail.  \n9. To abort all current changes tap back without tapping save.\n\n### Sharing / Importing\n\nBest is email, but there is a share sheet implementation to export out the faces, custom gallery/phone backgrounds and the JSON settings as a **.clk** file.  If you open one of these files on your phone with the OS handler, you should see and option for \"copy to AppleWatchFaces\" which will import it into the app.\n\n### Back-Up / Restore My Settings\n\nIf you need to re-install, or just want to manually edit the settings file. Use iTunes file sharing to save or overwrite the userClockSettingsV[XX].json file.  \n\n### Watch App\n\n1. When AppleWatchFaces is open on the watch, swipe left and right to cycle through the different designs in the iOS app.  \n2. Use the digital crown to test the face with different times, AKA \"time travel\".  Tap on the watch to go back to normal time.\n\n3. Set your watch to wake on last activity:\n\n    1. Open the Settings app  on your Apple Watch.\n    2. Go to General > Wake Screen, and make sure Wake Screen on Wrist Raise is turned on.\n    3. Scroll down and choose when you want your Apple Watch to wake to the last app you used: Always, Within 1 Hour of Last Use, Within 2 Minutes of Last Use, or While in Session (for apps like Workout, Remote, or Maps).\n    4. Choose While in Session if you want your Apple Watch to always wake to the watch face (except when you\u2019re still using an app).\n    5. You can also do this using the Apple Watch app on your iPhone: Tap My Watch, then go to General > Wake Screen.\n\n4. Keep the Apple Watch display on longer\n\n    1. Open the Settings app  on your Apple Watch.\n    2. Go to General > Wake Screen, then tap Wake for 70 Seconds.\n\n\n## Authors\n\nMike Hill - [@orffy](https://twitter.com/orffy)\nSylvian [@ElChoquito](https://twitter.com/SylGllr)\n\n## Special thanks\n\n[Jerome@iMrjX](https://twitter.com/iMrjX) for awesome faces (imrjx_design on instagram)\n[Emanuele Esposito@SkorpionBot](https://twitter.com/SkorpionBot) for his design expertise\n[@jonandrews74](https://twitter.com/jonandrews74) for creating awesome designs\n[@AppleWatchFanz](https://twitter.com/AppleWatchFanz) for creating some great designs\n[@nimbus12_](https://twitter.com/nimbus12_) for all around project support, photography, and designs\nand\n[@foz](https://twitter.com/foz) for helping me to kick off the idea\n\n## License\n\n`AppleWatchFaces` is released under the GPL-3 license.

  "readme_contents": "# apple2js\n\n## What is this?\n\nApple \\]\\[js and Apple //jse are Apple \\]\\[ and Apple //e emulators written entirely in JavaScript and HTML5.\n\nThings are still a little rough around the edges right now, hopefully I will have more time to clean things up.\n\nFirst\n\n```sh\nnpm install\n```\n\nTo run a development server\n\n```sh\nnpm start\n```\n\nThe open either\n[http://localhost:8080/apple2js.html](http://localhost:8080/apple2js.html) or\n[http://localhost:8080/apple2jse.html](http://localhost:8080/apple2jse.html)\n\nTo build a static distribution into `dist`\n\n```sh\nnpm run build\n```\n\nTo add additional disk images, use\n\n```sh\n./bin/dsk2json -c Category -n Name path/to/image.dsk > json/disks/image.json\n```\n\nthen\n\n```sh\n./bin/index\n```\n\n## Updates\n\n### 2019-03-02\n\n* Behind the scenes\n\n    A lot of not so visible changes behind the scenes. The website now runs directly off of github, and has a more modern toolchain (Goodbye make, Perl and closure compiler, hello Webpack!) to facilitate development.\n\n* Performance\n\n    In particular, the screen no longer redraws as quickly as possible.\n\n* Drag and Drop\n\n    Disk images can be dragged into the window to load them.\n\n* Contributions\n\n    Thanks to [Ian Flanigan](https://github.com/iflan) for additions to improve ChromeBook behavior.\n\n### 2017-10-08\n\n* Better iOS support\n\n    Bluetooth keyboards now work better. Reset is Ctrl-Shift-Delete. iOS now allows loading disks from iCloud and services like Drop Box. Saving locally is still not supported by iOS. I now understand why sound doesn't work, and I'm working on a work-around.\n\n* Source Maps\n\n    Although the source code has always been available, by default I serve up minified Javascript for performance reasons. But now you can poke around more easily.\n\n## Updates (2017-08-31)\n\n(It's been a long time since I updated, so this is a rough list)\n\n* Videx Videoterm Emulation (\\]\\[js)\n\n    PR#3 now does something on the Apple \\]\\[!.\n\n* AppleColor RGB Card Emulation (//jse)\n\n    Now supports a bunch of the mostly non-standard video formats found on the AppleColor RGB card, including 16 color text, 16 color hires mode, and mixed black and white and color double hires\n* Machine selection\n\n    You can now select between original, autostart and plus Apple \\]\\[s, and unenhanced and enhanced //es.\n\n## Updates (2013-07-04)\n\n* RAMFactor Emulation (//jse)\n\n    I now simulate having a 1 Megabyte RAMFactor card in slot 2.\n\n* Thunderclock Emulation\n\n    There is cursory emulation of the Thunderclock card, enough to keep ProDOS applications from asking you to enter the date all the time. ProDOS attempts to guess the year from the month, the day and the day of the week, something that needs to be patched every 6 years. This means newer versions think it's 1996, older versions are stuck in the 80s.\n\n* Firefox Nightly Joystick Support\n\n    Joystick support has yet to officially land, but the latest nightlies support the gamepad API.\n\n## Updates (2013-03-20)\n\n* Animation Frames\n\n    I've switched from using setInterval() to requestAnimationFrame() where supported. This, in conjunction with the graphics re-write, seems to smooth performance and provide a more stable CPU speed.\n* Graphics Re-Write\n\n    This (third) re-write of the graphics system should improve performance with graphics intensive programs. Rather than rendering each graphics update as it happens, updates are rendered each animation frame.\n\n## Updates (2013-03-12)\n\n* Apple //e\n\n    After much flailing, and much staring at MMU emulation code in despair, I've finally published my Apple //e emulator. It's probably a little more rough than I'd hoped, but it has a lot of features that I really wanted to get into it, like basic double hires support, and it uses the enhanced Apple //e ROMs.\n\n## Updates (2013-02-25)\n\n* Joystick Support\n\n    Chrome only so far, the nascent gamepad API has finally allowed me to add basic joystick support. I can now re-live my glory days of Skyfox.\n\n* Re-written CPU emulator\n\n    I finally got around to applying some of the many lessons I learned along the way writing my first CPU emulator in Javascript. The last re-working gave me about a 100% performance gain.\n\n* Finally Fixed Oregon Trail\n\n    This seems to have been a major disappointment for many people. I was able to make it as a banker, but I'm embarassed to reveal my score.\n\n* Competition\n\n    Now in addition to [Gil Megidish's](http://www.megidish.net/apple2js/) Apple2JS, there's a couple of new kids on the block, including [David Caldwell's](http://porkrind.org/a2/) Apple II+ emulator where he's put a lot more thought into the graphics rendering than I have, and [appletoo](https://github.com/nicholasbs/appletoo), which I just stumbled across while looking for David's emulator and haven't had much time to look at.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* A Browser with HTML5 Support\n\n    The most recent versions of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/), [Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/), and [Opera](https//www.opera.com/) all seem to work reasonably well these days,although variations in HTML5 support pop up, and occasionally a major release will move things around out from under me. IE prior to 9 lacks canvas tag support and is unsupported. [IE 9+](https://windows.microsoft.com/ie9) renders nicely on a modern machine.\n\n* Basic Knowledge of the Apple \\]\\[\n\n    If you don't know how to use an Apple \\]\\[, this won't be much fun for you.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n* I'm using the following libraries:\n\n  * [jQuery](https://jquery.com) and [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com)\n  * Base64 Utilities via [KvZ](http://kevin.vanzonneveld.net/)\n  * LED graphics from [Modern Life](http://modernl.com/).\n  * [CFFA2 Firmware](http://dreher.net/?s=projects/CFforAppleII&c=projects/CFforAppleII/downloads1.php) by Chris Schumann, Rich Dreher and Dave Lyons\n\n* I heavily referenced:\n\n  * [_Beneath Apple DOS_](http://www.scribd.com/doc/200679/Beneath-Apple-DOS-By-Don-Worth-and-Pieter-Lechner) by Don Worth and Pieter Lechner\n  * _Inside the Apple //e_ by Gary B.

You must supply your token credentials in the options.\n\n```javascript\nvar options = {\n  token: {\n    key: \"path/to/APNsAuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8\",\n    keyId: \"key-id\",\n    teamId: \"developer-team-id\"\n  },\n  production: false\n};\n\nvar apnProvider = new apn.Provider(options);\n```\n\nBy default, the provider will connect to the sandbox unless the environment variable `NODE_ENV=production` is set.\n\nFor more information about configuration options consult the [provider documentation](doc/provider.markdown).\n\nHelp with preparing the key and certificate files for connection can be found in the [wiki][certificateWiki]\n\n#### Connecting through an HTTP proxy\n\nIf you need to connect through an HTTP proxy, you simply need to provide the `proxy: {host, port}` option when creating the provider. For example:\n\n```javascript\nvar options = {\n  token: {\n    key: \"path/to/APNsAuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8\",\n    keyId: \"key-id\",\n    teamId: \"developer-team-id\"\n  },\n  proxy: {\n    host: \"192.168.10.92\",\n    port: 8080\n  },\n  production: false\n};\n\nvar apnProvider = new apn.Provider(options);\n```\n\nThe provider will first send an HTTP CONNECT request to the specified proxy in order to establish an HTTP tunnel. Once established, it will create a new secure connection to the Apple Push Notification provider API through the tunnel.\n\n### Sending a notification\nTo send a notification you will first need a device token from your app as a string\n\n```javascript\nlet deviceToken = \"a9d0ed10e9cfd022a61cb08753f49c5a0b0dfb383697bf9f9d750a1003da19c7\"\n```\n\nCreate a notification object, configuring it with the relevant parameters (See the [notification documentation](doc/notification.markdown) for more details.)\n\n```javascript\nvar note = new apn.Notification();\n\nnote.expiry = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 3600; // Expires 1 hour from now.\nnote.badge = 3;\nnote.sound = \"ping.aiff\";\nnote.alert = \"\\uD83D\\uDCE7 \\u2709 You have a new message\";\nnote.payload = {'messageFrom': 'John Appleseed'};\nnote.topic = \"<your-app-bundle-id>\";\n```\n\nSend the notification to the API with `send`, which returns a promise.\n\n```javascript\napnProvider.send(note, deviceToken).then( (result) => {\n  // see documentation for an explanation of result\n});\n```\n\nThis will result in the the following notification payload being sent to the device\n\n```json\n{\"messageFrom\":\"John Appleseed\",\"aps\":{\"badge\":3,\"sound\":\"ping.aiff\",\"alert\":\"\\uD83D\\uDCE7 \\u2709 You have a new message\"}}\n```\n\nYou should only create one `Provider` per-process for each certificate/key pair you have. You do not need to create a new `Provider` for each notification. If you are only sending notifications to one app then there is no need for more than one `Provider`. \n\nIf you are constantly creating `Provider` instances in your app, make sure to call `Provider.shutdown()` when you are done with each provider to release its resources and memory.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nYou are encouraged to read the extremely informative [Troubleshooting Push Notifications][tn2265] Tech Note in the first instance, in case your query is answered there.\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have any questions or difficulties working with the module, the [node-apn Google group][googlegroup] should be your first port of call.\n\nPlease include as much detail as possible - especially debug logs. If the problem is reproducible, sample code is also extremely helpful. GitHub Issues should only be created for verified problems and enhancements, this will allow them to be tracked more easily.\n\n## Resources\n\n* [Local and Push Notification Programming Guide: APNs Overview][pl]\n* [Apple Technical Note: Troubleshooting Push Notifications][tn2265]\n* [List of Projects, Applications and Companies Using Node-apn][pacapn]\n\n## Credits\n\nCreated by [Andrew Naylor][argon]\n\nThanks to: [Ian Babrou][bobrik], [dgthistle][dgthistle], [Keith Larsen][keithnlarsen], [Mike P][mypark], [Greg Berg\u00e9][neoziro], [Asad ur Rehman][AsadR], [Nebojsa Sabovic][nsabovic], [Alberto Gimeno][gimenete], [Randall Tombaugh][rwtombaugh], [Michael Stewart][thegreatmichael], [Olivier Louvignes][mgcrea], [porsager][porsager], [Craig Hockenberry][chockenberry]\n\n## License\n\nReleased under the MIT License\n\n> Copyright (c) 2013 Andrew Naylor\n>\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n> of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n> in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n> to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n> copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n> furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n>\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n> all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n>\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

It records events from `URLSession` or from frameworks that use it, such as `Alamofire`, and displays them using `PulseUI` views that you integrate directly into your app. This way Pulse console is available for everyone who has your test builds. You or your QA team can view the logs on the device and easily share them to attach to bug reports.\n\n**What Pulse is Not**\n\nPulse **is not** a network debugging proxy tool like Proxyman, Charles, or Wireshark. It *won't* automatically intercept all network traffic coming from your app or device. And to view logs in realtime, you need to use `PulseUI.framework` that you integrate into your app. The dedicated Pulse iOS and macOS also use `PulseUI.framework` and are there to view logs manually shared from other devices.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nPulse is easy to learn and use thanks to [**Pulse Docs**](https://kean.blog/pulse/home).\n\n<a href=\"https://kean.blog/pulse/home\">\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1567433/115163600-eea0cc80-a077-11eb-8b86-3113a657816f.png\">\n</a>\n\n## Pulse Pro\n\n[**Pulse Pro**](https://kean.blog/pulse/guides/pulse-pro) is a professional open-source macOS app that allows you to view logs in real-time. The app is designed to be flexible, expansive, and precise while using all the familiar macOS patterns. It makes it easy to navigate large log files with table and text modes, filters, scroller markers, an all-new network inspector, JSON filters, and more.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- [ZIPFoundation](https://github.com/weichsel/ZIPFoundation/) for archiving Pulse documents. It's included directly in the binary.\n\n## Minimum Requirements\n\n**PulseUI** views are available only on indicated platforms, but the framework can be installed in the app targeting the **PulseCore** platforms \u2013 you just won't be able to use the views.\n\n| Pulse          | Swift           | Xcode           | Platforms                                         |\n|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| PulseCore 0.14.0      | Swift 5.3       | Xcode 12.0      | iOS 11.0  / watchOS 6.0 / tvOS 11.0 / macOS 11.0 |\n| PulseUI 0.14.0      | Swift 5.3       | Xcode 12.0      | iOS 13.0 / watchOS 7.0 / tvOS 13.0 / macOS 11.0 |\n\n## License\n\nPulse is available under the MIT license.

If you want mark as `public`, you can use `entities_access_control` option.\n\n```protobuf\noption (.google.protobuf.swift_file_options).entities_access_control = PublicEntities;\n\nmessage MessageWithCustomOption\n{\n  optional string str = 1;\n}\n```\n\nGenerated class and all fields are marked a `public`:\n\n```swift\nfinal public class MessageWithCustomOption : GeneratedMessage\n```\n\n### Generate enum/message conforming to \"Error\" protocol\n\n```protobuf\noption (.google.protobuf.swift_enum_options).generate_error_type = true;\n```\n\n#### Example\n\n```protobuf\n\nimport 'google/protobuf/swift-descriptor.proto';\n\nenum ServiceError {\n  option (.google.protobuf.swift_enum_options).generate_error_type = true;\n  BadRequest = 0;\n  InternalServerError = 1;\n}\n\nmessage UserProfile {\n    message Request {\n        required string userId = 1;\n    }\n    message Response {\n        optional UserProfile profile = 1;\n        optional ServiceError error = 2;\n        optional Exception exception = 3;\n    }\n\n     message Exception {\n        option (.google.protobuf.swift_message_options).generate_error_type = true;\n        required int32 errorCode = 1;\n        required string errorDescription = 2;\n    }\n    \n    optional string firstName = 1;\n    optional string lastName = 2;\n    optional string avatarUrl = 3;\n}\n```\n\n```swift\npublic enum ServiceError:Error, RawRepresentable, CustomDebugStringConvertible, CustomStringConvertible {\n  public typealias RawValue = Int32\n\n  case badRequest\n  case internalServerError\n\n  public init?(rawValue: RawValue) {\n    switch rawValue {\n    case 0: self = .badRequest\n    case 1: self = .internalServerError\n    default: return nil\n    }\n  }\n\n  public var rawValue: RawValue {\n    switch self {\n    case .badRequest: return 0\n    case .internalServerError: return 1\n    }\n  }\n\n  public func throwException() throws {\n    throw self\n  }\n\n  public var debugDescription:String { return getDescription() }\n  public var description:String { return getDescription() }\n  private func getDescription() -> String { \n    switch self {\n    case .badRequest: return \".badRequest\"\n    case .internalServerError: return \".internalServerError\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n```swift\nfunc generateException()throws {\n    let user = UserProfile.Response.Builder()\n    user.error = .internalServerError\n    let data = try user.build().data()\n    let userError = try UserProfile.Response.parseFrom(data:data)\n    if userError.hasError {\n        throw userError.error //userError.error.throwException()\n    }\n}\n\ndo {\n    try generateException()\n} catch let err as ServiceError where err == .internalServerError {\n    XCTAssertTrue(true)\n} catch {\n    XCTAssertTrue(false)\n}\n\nfunc throwExceptionMessage() throws {\n  let exception = UserProfile.Exception.Builder()\n  exception.errorCode = 403\n  exception.errorDescription = \"Bad Request\"\n  let exc = try exception.build()\n  let data = try UserProfile.Response.Builder().setException(exc).build().data()\n  let userError = try UserProfile.Response.parseFrom(data:data)\n  if userError.hasException {\n      throw userError.exception\n  }\n}\n\ndo {\n    try throwExceptionMessage()\n} catch let err as UserProfile.Exception {\n    print(err)\n    XCTAssertTrue(true)\n} catch {\n    XCTAssertTrue(false)\n}\n  \n```\n\n### Compile for framework\n\n```protobuf\noption (.google.protobuf.swift_file_options).compile_for_framework = false;\n```\n\nThis option deletes the string `import ProtocolBuffers` of the generated files.\n\n#### If you will need some other options, write me. I will add them.\n\n\n\n\n## Utilities (ProtocolBuffers 3.0)\n\nAdded well-known type protos (any.proto, empty.proto, timestamp.proto, duration.proto, etc.). Users can import and use these protos just like regular proto files. Addtional runtime support will be added for them in future releases (in the form of utility helper functions, or having them replaced by language specific types in generated code).\n#### Any\n```protobuf\nmessage Any {\n  // A URL/resource name whose content describes the type of the\n  // serialized message.\n  //\n  // For URLs which use the schema `http`, `https`, or no schema, the\n  // following restrictions and interpretations apply:\n  //\n  // * If no schema is provided, `https` is assumed.\n  // * The last segment of the URL's path must represent the fully\n  //   qualified name of the type (as in `path/google.protobuf.Duration`).\n  // * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][google.protobuf.Type]\n  //   value in binary format, or produce an error.\n  // * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the\n  //   URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any\n  //   lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved\n  //   on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage\n  //   breaking changes.)\n  //\n  // Schemas other than `http`, `https` (or the empty schema) might be\n  // used with implementation specific semantics.\n  //\n  // Types originating from the `google.*` package\n  // namespace should use `type.googleapis.com/full.type.name` (without\n  // schema and path).

It does so by stripping the flags that are today obsolete or rarely used. With good approximation, it mimics the most relevant features you will find in the official OpenVPN and WireGuard clients.\n\nNot to mention iCloud support, which makes your VPN profiles available on all your devices without any additional effort!\n\n[<img src=\"res/ios/snap-profile.png\" width=\"300\">](res/ios/snap-profile.png)\n\n### Trusted networks\n\nTrust Wi-Fi, cellular (iOS) or wired (macOS) networks to fine-grain your connectivity. You can then choose to retain a VPN connection when entering a trusted network, or prevent it completely.\n\n[<img src=\"res/ios/snap-trusted.png\" width=\"300\">](res/ios/snap-trusted.png)\n\n### Siri shortcuts\n\nEnjoy the convenience of Siri shortcuts to automate frequent VPN actions.\n\n[<img src=\"res/ios/snap-shortcuts.png\" width=\"300\">](res/ios/snap-shortcuts.png)\n\n### Override network settings\n\nOverride default gateway, DNS (plus DoH/DoT), proxy and MTU settings right from the app. Don't bother editing the configuration file or your server settings. This is especially useful if you want to override your provider settings, e.g. to integrate your own DNS-based ad blocking.\n\n[<img src=\"res/ios/snap-network.png\" width=\"300\">](res/ios/snap-network.png)\n\n### See your connection parameters\n\nPassepartout strives for transparency, by showing a fairly detailed yet understandable resume of your connection parameters.\n\n[<img src=\"res/ios/snap-parameters.png\" width=\"300\">](res/ios/snap-parameters.png)\n\n### Disconnect on sleep\n\nKeeping the VPN active in the background provides smoother operation, but may be tough for the battery. You might want to use this feature if you're concerned about battery life. When the device goes to sleep, the VPN will disconnect to then reconnect on device wake-up.\n\n### No unrequested activity\n\nPassepartout is a VPN client and does absolutely nothing else without your consent. The providers infrastructures are obtained via a [static GitHub API][app-api] if and only if you manually refresh them.\n\n### Presets for major providers\n\nPassepartout can connect to a few well-known VPN providers with an existing account:\n\n- [Hide.me][app-net-hideme]\n- [Mullvad][app-net-mullvad]\n- [NordVPN][app-net-nordvpn]\n- [Oeck][app-net-oeck]\n- [Private Internet Access][app-net-pia]\n- [ProtonVPN][app-net-protonvpn]\n- [SurfShark][app-net-surfshark]\n- [TorGuard][app-net-torguard]\n- [TunnelBear][app-net-tunnelbear]\n- [VyprVPN][app-net-vyprvpn]\n- [Windscribe][app-net-windscribe]\n\nIn preset mode, you can pick pre-resolved IPv4 endpoints when DNS is problematic.\n\n### Import configuration files\n\nPassepartout can import .ovpn (OpenVPN) and .conf/.wg (WireGuard) configuration files as is. You can find details on what may or may not work in the related section of the [TunnelKit README][dep-tunnelkit-ovpn].\n\n## Installation\n\n### Requirements\n\n- iOS 14+ / macOS 11+\n- Xcode 13+ (SwiftPM 5.3)\n- Git (preinstalled with Xcode Command Line Tools)\n- Ruby (preinstalled with macOS)\n- golang\n\nIt's highly recommended to use the Git and Ruby packages provided by [Homebrew][dep-brew].\n\n### Testing\n\nDownload the app codebase locally:\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/passepartout-apple.git\n\nEnter the directory and clone the submodules:\n\n    $ git submodule init\n    $ git submodule update\n\nFor everything to work properly, make sure to comply with all the capabilities/entitlements, both in the main app and the tunnel extension target.\n\nMake sure to update `Config.xcconfig` according to your developer account and your identifiers:\n\n    CFG_TEAM_ID = A1B2C3D4E5\n    CFG_APP_ID = com.example.MyApp\n    CFG_APP_LAUNCHER_ID = com.example.MyApp.Launcher // macOS only\n    CFG_GROUP_ID = com.example.MyAppGroup // omit the \"group.\" prefix\n    CFG_APPSTORE_ID = 1234567890 // optional for development, can be bogus\n\nAlso, `PATH` must include your golang installation in order to compile WireGuardKit:\n    \n    PATH = $(PATH):/path/to/golang\n\nTo eventually test the app, open `Passepartout.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run the `Passepartout` target.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 Davide De Rosa.

Real devices communication is ensured by [appium-ios-device](https://github.com/appium/appium-ios-device) library.\nSimulators communication is ensured by [appium-ios-simulator](https://github.com/appium/appium-ios-simulator) library.\n\nIn the native mode the driver operates in scope of [WebDriver W3C protocol](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver) with several platform-specific extensions. Web views communication only supports the obsolete [JWP protocol](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/jsonwp.html).\n\n*Note*: Issue tracking for this repo has been disabled. Please use the [main Appium issue tracker](https://github.com/appium/appium/issues) instead.\n\n\n## Requirements\n\nOn top of standard Appium requirements XCUITest driver also expects the following prerequisites:\n\n- Only macOS is supported as the host platform\n- Xcode and developer tools must be installed. Note, that usually some time is needed for the Appium team to pick up with the support of the most recent Xcode versions, especially beta ones.\n- Connected real devices must be trusted, added to your developer profile and configured properly along with WebDriverAgent signing. Read [Real devices](#real-devices) section _carefully_ to set them up properly before running your tests.\n    - Starting from iOS/iPadOS version iOS/iPadOS 16 real devices require enabling of _Developer Mode_ option in _Settings -> Privacy & Security_\n- The minimum supported Xcode SDK version for the current driver snapshot is *10.2 (iOS 12.2)*. Consider using earlier releases of the driver (see [Xcode version support](#xcode-version-support) section below) if it is necessary to test older iOS versions on real devices. Also, it is highly recommended to always use the same major version of Xcode SDK, which was used to build the particular iOS/tvOS version on your real device under test (for example Xcode 11 for iOS 13, Xcode 12 for iOS 14, etc).\n- Web views must be debuggable in order to test them. If it is not possible to connect to your web view(s) using [Safari remote debugger](https://appletoolbox.com/use-web-inspector-debug-mobile-safari/) then XCUITest won't be able to connect to them as well.\n- Since version 3.33.0 (included into Appium 1.20.0+) of XCUITest driver the [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) dependency *is not needed anymore*. Prior to that version it was required and could be installed using [brew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install carthage`.\n\n## Optional dependencies\n\n- [xcpretty](https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty) tool could be used to make Xcode output easier to read. It could be installed using `gem install xcpretty` command.\n- For test video recording we use [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/). It could be installed using [brew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install ffmpeg`\n- [IDB](https://github.com/facebook/idb), [go-ios](https://github.com/danielpaulus/go-ios) and [tidevice](https://github.com/alibaba/taobao-iphone-device) could be used to improve some real device/Simulator interactions\n- [WIX AppleSimulatorUtils](https://github.com/wix/AppleSimulatorUtils) could be used to improve some Simulator interactions\n\n\n## Xcode version support\n\n* module versions below `2.96.0` only supports XCode 8 and newer\n* module version `2.96.0` and above only supports XCode 9 and newer\n* module version `3.0.0` and above only supports Xcode 10 and newer\n* module version `3.32.0` and above only supports Xcode 10.2 and newer\n\n\n## Real devices\n\n### Configuration\n\nSee [real device configuration documentation](docs/real-device-config.md).\n\n### Known problems\n\n- After many failures on real devices it could transition to a state where connections are no longer being accepted. To possibly remedy this issue reboot the device. Read https://github.com/facebook/WebDriverAgent/issues/507 for more details.\n- iPhone/iPad real devices show overlay, which has `Automation Running Hold both volume buttons to stop` text, since iOS/iPadOS 15. This is a known limitation of XCTest framework. This limitation does not affect screenshooting APIs though (e.g. the overlay is not visible on taken screenshots).\n- iPhone/iPad real devices [require passcode or touch id](https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/15898#issuecomment-927340411) when they start a XCTest session since iOS/iPadOS 15. Disabling passcode/touch id in the device preference allows to workaround the behaviour above.\n- OpenSSL v3 breaks secured communication with real devices. It can cause a [Failed to receive any data within the timeout](https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/16399) error in [appium-ios-device](https://github.com/appium/appium-ios-device). Please read [this issue](https://github.com/appium/appium-ios-device/pull/88#discussion_r825315862) for more details.\n    - Please make sure your environment has Open SSL v1 for NodeJS environment, or prepare an OpenSSL v3 build by patching `OPENSSL_TLS_SECURITY_LEVEL=1`. (e.g. [an article](https://www.feistyduck.com/library/openssl-cookbook/online/ch-openssl.html))\n    - This configuration is only necessary for XCUITest driver v4.3.0 or lower.\n\n#### Weird state\n\n**Note:** Running `WebDriverAgent` tests on a real device is particularly flakey. If things stop responding, the only recourse is, most often, to restart the device. Logs in the form of the following _may_ start to occur:\n\n```shell\ninfo JSONWP Proxy Proxying [POST /session] to [POST http://10.35.4.122:8100/session] with body: {\"desiredCapabilities\":{\"ap...\"\ndbug WebDriverAgent Device: Jul 26 13:20:42 iamPhone XCTRunner[240] <Warning>: Listening on USB\ndbug WebDriverAgent Device: Jul 26 13:21:42 iamPhone XCTRunner[240] <Warning>: Enqueue Failure: UI Testing Failure - Unable to update application state promptly. <unknown> 0 1\ndbug WebDriverAgent Device: Jul 26 13:21:57 iamPhone XCTRunner[240] <Warning>: Enqueue Failure: UI Testing Failure - Failed to get screenshot within 15s <unknown> 0 1\ndbug WebDriverAgent Device: Jul 26 13:22:57 iamPhone XCTRunner[240] <Warning>: Enqueue Failure: UI Testing Failure - App state of (null) is still unknown <unknown> 0 1\n```\n\n### Real device security settings\n\nOn some systems, especially CI ones, where tests are executed by a command line agents, macOS Accessibility restrictions make the `WebDriverAgent` system unable to retrieve the development keys from the system keychain. This is usually manifest\nby `xcodebuild` returning an error code `65`. A workaround for this is to use a private key that is not stored on the system\nkeychain. See [this issue](https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/6955) and [this Stack Exchange post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16550594/jenkins-xcode-build-works-codesign-fails).\n\nTo export the key, use\n\n```\nsecurity create-keychain -p [keychain_password] MyKeychain.keychain\nsecurity import MyPrivateKey.p12 -t agg -k MyKeychain.keychain -P [p12_Password] -A\n```\n\nwhere `MyPrivateKey.p12` is the private development key exported from the system keychain.\n\nThe full path to the keychain can then be sent to the Appium system using the `keychainPath` desired capability,\nand the password sent through the `keychainPassword` capability.\n\n## Appium 2.x Server Arguments\n\nThese arguments are set when you launch the Appium server, with this driver installed. They are for system administrators.\n\nUsage: `appium --driver-args='{\"xcuitest\": {[argName]: [argValue]}}'`\n\n<expand_table>\n\n|Argument|Default|Description|Example|\n|----|-------|-----------|-------|\n|`\"wdaLocalPort\"`|8100| Local port used for communication with ios-web-driver-agent|`--driver-args='{\"xcuitest\": {\"wdaLocalPort\": 8100}}'`|\n\n## Capabilities\n\n### General\n\nCapability | Description\n--- | ---\n`platformName` | Could be set to `ios`. Appium itself is not strict about this capability value if `automationName` is provided, so feel free to assign it to any supported platform name if this is needed, for example, to make Selenium Grid working.\n`appium:automationName` | Must always be set to `xcuitest`. Values of `automationName` are compared case-insensitively.\n`appium:deviceName` | The name of the device under test. Consider setting `udid` for real devices and use this one for Simulator selection instead\n`appium:platformVersion` | The platform version of an emulator or a real device. This capability is used for device autodetection if `udid` is not provided\n`appium:udid` | UDID of the device to be tested. Could be retrieved from Xcode->Window->Devices and Simulators window. Always set this capability if you run parallel tests or use a real device to run your tests.\n`appium:noReset` | Prevents the device to be reset before the session startup if set to `true`. This means that the application under test is not going to be terminated neither its data cleaned. `false` by default\n`appium:fullReset` | Being set to `true` always enforces the application under test to be fully uninstalled before starting a new session. `false` by default\n`appium:printPageSourceOnFindFailure` | Enforces the server to dump the actual XML page source into the log if any error happens. `false` by default.\n`browserName` | The name of the browser to run the test on. If this capability is provided then the driver will try to start the test in Web context mode (Native mode is applied by default). Read [Automating hybrid apps](https://appium.io/docs/en/writing-running-appium/web/hybrid/) for more details. Usually equals to `safari`.\n`appium:includeDeviceCapsToSessionInfo` | Whether to include screen information as the result of [Get Session Capabilities](http://appium.io/docs/en/commands/session/get/). It includes `pixelRatio`, `statBarHeight` and `viewportRect`, but it causes an extra API call to WDA which may increase the response time like [this issue](https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/15101). Defaults to `true`.\n`appium:resetLocationService` | Whether reset the location service in the session deletion on real device. Defaults to `false`.\n\n### App\n\nCapability | Description\n--- | ---\n`appium:bundleId` | Bundle identifier of the app under test, for example `com.mycompany.myapp`. The capability value is calculated automatically if `app` is provided. If neither `app` or `bundleId` capability is provided then XCUITest driver starts from the Home screen.\n`appium:app` | Full path to the application to be tested (the app must be located on the same machine where the server is running). `.ipa` and `.app` application extensions are supported. Zipped `.app` bundles are supported as well. Could also be an URL to a remote location. If neither of the `app` or `bundleId` capabilities are provided then the driver starts from the Home screen and expects the test to know what to do next. Do not provide both `app` and `browserName` capabilities at once.\n`appium:localizableStringsDir` | Where to look for localizable strings in the application bundle. Defaults to `en.lproj`\n`appium:otherApps` | App or list of apps (as a JSON array) to install prior to running tests. Note that it will not work with iOS real devices. Fore example: `[\"http://appium.github.io/appium/assets/TestApp9.4.app.zip\", \"/path/to/app-b.app\"]`\n`appium:language` | Language to set for iOS, for example `fr`. Please read [Language IDs](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/LanguageandLocaleIDs/LanguageandLocaleIDs.html) to get more details abuot available values for this capability.\n`appium:locale` | Locale to set for iOS, for example `fr_CA`. Please read [Locale IDs](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/LanguageandLocaleIDs/LanguageandLocaleIDs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000171i-CH15-SW9) to get more details abuot available values for this capability.\n`appium:appPushTimeout` | The timeout for application upload in milliseconds. Works for real devices only. The default value is `30000`ms\n`appium:appInstallStrategy` | Select application installation strategy for real devices. The following strategies are supported: `serial` (default) - pushes app files to the device in a sequential order; this is the least performant strategy, although the most reliable; `parallel` - pushes app files simultaneously; this is usually the the most performant strategy, but sometimes could not be very stable; `ios-deploy` - tells the driver to use a third-party tool [ios-deploy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ios-deploy) to install the app; obviously the tool must be installed separately first and must be present in PATH before it could be used. | parallel\n\n### WebDriverAgent\n\n|Capability|Description|Values|\n|----------|-----------|------|\n|`appium:xcodeOrgId`|Apple developer team identifier string. Must be used in conjunction with `xcodeSigningId` to take effect.|e.g., `JWL241K123`|\n|`appium:xcodeSigningId`|String representing a signing certificate. Must be used in conjunction with `xcodeOrgId`. This is usually just `iPhone Developer`, so the default (if not included) is `iPhone Developer`|e.g., `iPhone Developer`|\n|`appium:xcodeConfigFile`|Full path to an optional Xcode configuration file that specifies the code signing identity and team for running the `WebDriverAgent` on the real device.|e.g., `/path/to/myconfig.xcconfig`|\n|`appium:updatedWDABundleId`|Bundle id to update WDA to before building and launching on real devices. This bundle id _must_ be associated with a valid provisioning profile.|e.g., `io.appium.WebDriverAgentRunner`|\n|`appium:keychainPath`|Full path to the private development key exported from the system keychain. Used in conjunction with `keychainPassword` when testing on real devices.|e.g., `/path/to/MyPrivateKey.p12`|\n|`appium:keychainPassword`|Password for unlocking keychain specified in `keychainPath`.|e.g., `super awesome password`|\n|`appium:derivedDataPath`| Use along with *usePrebuiltWDA* capability and choose where to search for the existing WDA app. If the capability is not set then Xcode will store the derived data in the default root taken from preferences.|\n|`appium:webDriverAgentUrl`|If provided, Appium will connect to an existing `WebDriverAgent` instance at this URL instead of starting a new one.|e.g., `http://localhost:8100`|\n|`appium:useNewWDA`|If `true`, forces uninstall of any existing `WebDriverAgent` app on device. Set it to `true` if you want to apply different startup options for `WebDriverAgent` for each session. Although, it is only guaranteed to work stable on Simulator. Real devices require `WebDriverAgent` client to run for as long as possible without reinstall/restart to avoid issues like https://github.com/facebook/WebDriverAgent/issues/507. The `false` value (the default behaviour since driver version 2.35.0) will try to detect currently running WDA listener executed by previous testing session(s) and reuse it if possible, which is highly recommended for real device testing and to speed up suites of multiple tests in general. A new WDA session will be triggered at the default URL (http://localhost:8100) if WDA is not listening and `webDriverAgentUrl` capability is not set. The negative/unset value of `useNewWDA` capability has no effect prior to xcuitest driver version 2.35.0.|e.g., `true`|\n|`appium:wdaLaunchTimeout`|Time, in ms, to wait for `WebDriverAgent` to be pingable. Defaults to 60000ms.|e.g., `30000`|\n|`appium:wdaConnectionTimeout`|Timeout, in ms, for waiting for a response from `WebDriverAgent`. Defaults to 240000ms.|e.g., `1000`|\n|`appium:wdaStartupRetries`|Number of times to try to build and launch `WebDriverAgent` onto the device. Defaults to 2.|e.g., `4`|\n|`appium:wdaStartupRetryInterval`|Time, in ms, to wait between tries to build and launch `WebDriverAgent`. Defaults to 10000ms.|e.g., `20000`|\n|`appium:wdaLocalPort`|This value if specified, will be used to forward traffic from Mac host to real ios devices over USB. Default value is same as port number used by WDA on device.|e.g., `8100`|\n|`appium:wdaBaseUrl`| This value if specified, will be used as a prefix to build a custom `WebDriverAgent` url. It is different from `webDriverAgentUrl`, because if the latter is set then it expects `WebDriverAgent` to be already listening and skips the building phase. Defaults to `http://localhost` | e.g., `http://192.168.1.100`|\n|`appium:showXcodeLog`|Whether to display the output of the Xcode command used to run the tests. If this is `true`, there will be **lots** of extra logging at startup. Defaults to `false`|e.g., `true`|\n|`appium:iosInstallPause`|Time in milliseconds to pause between installing the application and starting `WebDriverAgent` on the device. Used particularly for larger applications. Defaults to `0`|e.g., `8000`|\n|`appium:usePrebuiltWDA`|Skips the build phase of running the WDA app. Building is then the responsibility of the user. Only works for Xcode 8+. Defaults to `false`.|e.g., `true`|\n|`appium:shouldUseSingletonTestManager`|Use default proxy for test management within `WebDriverAgent`. Setting this to `false` sometimes helps with socket hangup problems. Defaults to `true`.|e.g., `false`|\n|`appium:waitForIdleTimeout`|The amount of time in float seconds to wait until the application under test is idling. XCTest requires the app's main thread to be idling in order to execute any action on it, so WDA might not even start/freeze if the app under test is constantly hogging the main thread. The default value is `10` (seconds). Setting it to zero disables idling checks completely (not recommended) and has the same effect as setting `waitForQuiescence` to `false`. Available since Appium 1.20.0. |\n|`appium:useXctestrunFile`|Use Xctestrun file to launch WDA. It will search for such file in `bootstrapPath`. Expected name of file is `WebDriverAgentRunner_iphoneos<sdkVersion>-arm64.xctestrun` for real device and `WebDriverAgentRunner_iphonesimulator<sdkVersion>-x86_64.xctestrun` for simulator. One can do `build-for-testing` for `WebDriverAgent` project for simulator and real device and then you will see [Product Folder like this](docs/useXctestrunFile.png) and you need to copy content of this folder at `bootstrapPath` location. Since this capability expects that you have already built `WDA` project, it neither checks whether you have necessary dependencies to build `WDA` nor will it try to build project. Defaults to `false`. _Tips: `Xcodebuild` builds for the target platform version. We'd recommend you to build with minimal OS version which you'd like to run as the original WDA module. e.g. If you build WDA for 12.2, the module cannot run on iOS 11.4 because of loading some module error on simulator. A module built with 11.4 can work on iOS 12.2. (This is xcodebuild's expected behaviour.)_ |e.g., `true`|\n|`appium:useSimpleBuildTest`| Build with `build` and run test with `test` in xcodebuild for all Xcode version if this is `true`, or build with `build-for-testing` and run tests with `test-without-building` for over Xcode 8 if this is `false`. Defaults to `false`. | `true` or `false` |\n|`appium:wdaEventloopIdleDelay`|Delays the invocation of `-[XCUIApplicationProcess setEventLoopHasIdled:]` by the number of seconds specified with this capability. This can help quiescence apps that fail to do so for no obvious reason (and creating a session fails for that reason). This increases the time for session creation because `-[XCUIApplicationProcess setEventLoopHasIdled:]` is called multiple times. If you enable this capability start with at least `3` seconds and try increasing it, if creating the session still fails. Defaults to `0`. |e.g. `5`|\n|`appium:processArguments`|Process arguments and environment which will be sent to the `WebDriverAgent` server in a new session request. Please use [mobile:launchApp](https://github.com/appium/appium-xcuitest-driver#mobile-launchapp) to launch an application with process arguments in the middle of a session. |`{ args: [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"] , env: { \"a\": \"b\", \"c\": \"d\" } }` or `'{\"args\": [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], \"env\": { \"a\": \"b\", \"c\": \"d\" }}'`|\n|`appium:autoLaunch`|When set to `false`, prevents the application under test from being launched automatically as a part of the new session startup process. The launch become the responsibility of the user. Defaults to `true`.|`true` or `false`|\n|`appium:allowProvisioningDeviceRegistration`|Allow `xcodebuild` to register your destination device on the developer portal if necessary. Requires a developer account to have been added in Xcode's Accounts preference pane. Defaults to `false`.|`true` or `false`|\n|`appium:resultBundlePath`| Specify the path to the result bundle path as `xcodebuild` argument for `WebDriverAgent` build under a security flag (Please check _Opt-in Features_ section below). `WebDriverAgent` process must start/stop every time to pick up changed value of this property. Specifying `useNewWDA` to `true` may help there. Please read `man xcodebuild` for more details. | e.g. `/path/to/resultbundle` |\n|`appium:resultBundleVersion`| Specify the version of result bundle as `xcodebuild` argument for `WebDriverAgent` build. The default value depends on your Xcode version. Please read `man xcodebuild` for more details. | e.g. `/path/to/resultbundle` |\n|`appium:maxTypingFrequency`|Maximum frequency of keystrokes for typing and clear. If your tests are failing because of typing errors, you may want to adjust this. Defaults to 60 keystrokes per minute.|e.g., `30`|\n|`appium:simpleIsVisibleCheck`|Use native methods for determining visibility of elements. In some cases this takes a long time. Setting this capability to `false` will cause the system to use the position and size of elements to make sure they are visible on the screen. This can, however, lead to false results in some situations. Defaults to `false`, except iOS 9.3, where it defaults to `true`. | e.g., `true`, `false`|\n|`appium:waitForQuiescence`| It allows to turn on/off waiting for application quiescence in `WebDriverAgent`, while performing queries. The default value is `true`. You can avoid [this kind of issues](https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/11132) if you turn it off. Consider using `waitForIdleTimeout` capability instead for this purpose since Appium 1.20.0 | e.g `false` |\n|`appium:mjpegServerPort`|The port number on which WDA broadcasts screenshots stream encoded into MJPEG format from the device under test. It might be necessary to change this value if the default port is busy because of other tests running in parallel. Default value: `9100`|e.g. `12000`|\n|`appium:screenshotQuality`| Changes the quality of phone display screenshots following [xctest/xctimagequality](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctimagequality?language=objc)  Default value is `1`. `0` is the highest and `2` is the lowest quality. You can also change it via [settings](https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/en/advanced-concepts/settings.md) command. `0` might cause OutOfMemory crash on high-resolution devices like iPad Pro. | e.g. `0`, `1`, `2` |\n|`appium:autoAcceptAlerts`| Accept all iOS alerts automatically if they pop up. This includes privacy access permission alerts (e.g., location, contacts, photos). Default is `false`. |`true` or `false`|\n|`appium:autoDismissAlerts`| Dismiss all iOS alerts automatically if they pop up. This includes privacy access permission alerts (e.g., location, contacts, photos). Default is `false`. |`true` or `false`|\n|`appium:disableAutomaticScreenshots`| Disable automatic screenshots taken by XCTest at every interaction. Default is up to `WebDriverAgent`'s config to decide, which currently defaults to `true`. |`true` or `false`|\n|`appium:shouldTerminateApp`| Specify if the app should be terminated on session end. This capability only has an effect if an application identifier has been passed to the test session (either explicitly, by setting bundleId, or implicitly, by providing app). Default is `true` unless `noReset` capability is set to `true`. |`true` or `false`|\n|`appium:forceAppLaunch`| Specify if the app should be forcefully restarted if it is already running on session startup. This capability only has an effect if an application identifier has been passed to the test session (either explicitly, by setting bundleId, or implicitly, by providing app). Default is `true` unless `noReset` capability is set to `true`. |`true` or `false`|\n|`appium:useNativeCachingStrategy`| Set this capability to `false` in order to use the custom elements caching strategy. This might help to avoid stale element exception on property change. By default the native XCTest cache resolution is used (`true`) for all native locators (e.g. all, but xpath). Check the corresponding [WebDriverAgent pull request](https://github.com/appium/WebDriverAgent/pull/516) for more details. |`true` or `false`|\n\n### Simulator\n\n|Capability|Description|Values|\n|----------|-----------|------|\n|`appium:orientation`|Start a test in a certain orientation|`LANDSCAPE` or `PORTRAIT`|\n|`appium:scaleFactor`|Simulator scale factor. This is useful to have if the default resolution of simulated device is greater than the actual display resolution. So you can scale the simulator to see the whole device screen without scrolling.|Acceptable values for simulators running Xcode SDK 8 and older are: `'1.0', '0.75', '0.5', '0.33' and '0.25'`, where '1.0' means 100% scale. For simulators running Xcode SDK 9 and above the value could be any valid positive float number. The capability must be of a string type.|\n|`appium:connectHardwareKeyboard`|Set this option to `true` in order to enable hardware keyboard in Simulator. The preference works only when Appium launches a simulator instance with this value. It is set to `false` by default, because this helps to workaround some XCTest bugs. `connectHardwareKeyboard: true` makes `forceSimulatorSoftwareKeyboardPresence: false` if no explicit value is set for `forceSimulatorSoftwareKeyboardPresence` capability since Appium 1.22.0. |`true` or `false`|\n|`appium:forceSimulatorSoftwareKeyboardPresence`|Set this option to `true` in order to turn software keyboard on and turn hardware keyboard off in Simulator since Appium 1.22.0. This option helps to avoid `Keyboard is not present` error. It is set to `true` by default. Appium respects preset simulator software/hardware keyboard preference when this value is `false`, so `connectHardwareKeyboard: false` and `forceSimulatorSoftwareKeyboardPresence: false` means for Appium to keep the current Simulator keyboard preferences. This option has priority over `connectHardwareKeyboard`. |`true` or `false`|\n|`appium:calendarAccessAuthorized`|Set this to `true` if you want to enable calendar access on IOS Simulator with given bundleId. Set to `false`, if you want to disable calendar access on IOS Simulator with given bundleId. If not set, the calendar authorization status will not be set.|e.g., `true`|\n|`appium:calendarFormat`|Calendar format to set for the iOS Simulator|e.g. `gregorian`|\n|`appium:isHeadless`|Set this capability to `true` if automated tests are running on Simulator and the device display is not needed to be visible. This only has an effect since Xcode9 and only for simulators. All running instances of Simulator UI are going to be automatically terminated if headless test is started. `false` is the default value.|e.g., `true`|\n|`appium:simulatorWindowCenter`|Allows to explicitly set the coordinates of Simulator window center for Xcode9+ SDK. This capability only has an effect if Simulator window has not been opened yet for the current session before it started.|e.g. `{-100.0,100.0}` or `{500,500}`, spaces are not allowed|\n|`appium:simulatorStartupTimeout`|Allows to change the default timeout for Simulator startup. By default this value is set to 120000ms (2 minutes), although the startup could take longer on a weak hardware or if other concurrent processes use much system resources during the boot up procedure.|e.g. `300000`|\n|`appium:simulatorTracePointer`|Whether to highlight pointer moves in the Simulator window. The Simulator UI client must be shut down before the session startup in order for this capability to be applied properly. `false` by default.|e.g. `true`|\n|`appium:shutdownOtherSimulators`|If this capability set to `true` and the current device under test is an iOS Simulator then Appium will try to shutdown all the other running Simulators before to start a new session. This might be useful while executing webview tests on different devices, since only one device can be debugged remotely at once due to an Apple bug. The capability only has an effect if `--relaxed-security` command line argument is provided to the server. Defaults to `false`.|e.g. `true`|\n|`appium:enforceFreshSimulatorCreation`| Creates a new simulator in session creation and deletes it in session deletion. Defaults to `false`. | `true` or `false` |\n|`appium:keepKeyChains`|Set the capability to `true` in order to preserve Simulator keychains folder after full reset. This feature has no effect on real devices. Defaults to `false`|e.g. `true`|\n|`appium:keychainsExcludePatterns`|This capability accepts comma-separated path patterns, which are going to be excluded from keychains restore while full reset is being performed on Simulator. It might be useful if you want to exclude only particular keychain types from being restored, like the applications keychain. This feature has no effect on real devices.|e.g. `*keychain*.db*` to exclude applications keychain from being restored|\n|`appium:reduceMotion`| It allows to turn on/off reduce motion accessibility preference. Setting reduceMotion `on` helps to reduce flakiness during tests. Only on simulators | e.g `true` |\n|`appium:permissions`| Allows to set permissions for the specified application bundle on Simulator only. The capability value is expected to be a valid JSON string with `{\"<bundleId1>\": {\"<serviceName1>\": \"<serviceStatus1>\", ...}, ...}` format. Since Xcode SDK 11.4 Apple provides native APIs to interact with application settings. Check the output of `xcrun simctl privacy booted` command to get the list of available permission names. Use `yes`, `no` and `unset` as values in order to `grant`, `revoke` or `reset` the corresponding permission. Below Xcode SDK 11.4 it is required that `applesimutils` package is installed and available in PATH. The list of available service names and statuses can be found at https://github.com/wix/AppleSimulatorUtils. | e. g. `{\"com.apple.mobilecal\": {\"calendar\": \"YES\"}}` |\n|`appium:iosSimulatorLogsPredicate`|Set the `--predicate` flag in the ios simulator logs|e.g.: `'process != \"locationd\" AND process != \"DTServiceHub\"' AND process != \"mobileassetd\"`|\n|`appium:simulatorPasteboardAutomaticSync`| Handle the `-PasteboardAutomaticSync` flag when simulator process launches. It could improve launching simulator performance not to sync pasteboard with the system when this value is `off`. `on` forces the flag enabled. `system` does not provide the flag to the launching command. `on`, `off`, or `system` is available. They are case insensitive. Defaults to `off` | e.g. `system` |\n|`appium:simulatorDevicesSetPath`| This capability allows to set an alternative path to the simulator devices set in case you have multiple sets deployed on your local system. Such feature could be useful if you, for example, would like to save disk space on the main system volume. | e.g. `/MyVolume/Devices` |\n|`appium:customSSLCert`| Adds a root SSL certificate to IOS Simulators and real devices. Real devices only work if [py-ios-device](https://github.com/YueChen-C/py-ios-device) tool is available on the server machine. The certificate content must be provided in [PEM](https://knowledge.digicert.com/quovadis/ssl-certificates/ssl-general-topics/what-is-pem-format.html) format | e.g. ```-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----MIIFWjCCBEKg...-----END CERTIFICATE-----```|\n|`appium:webkitResponseTimeout`| (Real device only) Set the time, in ms, to wait for a response from WebKit in a Safari session. Defaults to `5000` | e.g., `10000`|\n\n### Web Context\n\n|Capability|Description|Values|\n|----------|-----------|------|\n|`appium:absoluteWebLocations`|This capability will direct the `Get Element Location` command, when used within webviews, to return coordinates which are relative to the origin of the page, rather than relative to the current scroll offset. This capability has no effect outside of webviews. Default `false`.|e.g., `true`|\n|`appium:safariGarbageCollect`|Turns on/off Web Inspector garbage collection when executing scripts on Safari. Turning on may improve performance. Defaults to `false`.|`true` or `false`|\n|`appium:includeSafariInWebviews`|Add Safari web contexts to the list of contexts available during a native/webview app test. This is useful if the test opens Safari and needs to be able to interact with it. Defaults to `false`.|`true` or `false`|\n|`appium:safariLogAllCommunication`|Log all plists sent to and received from the Web Inspector, as plain text. For some operations this can be a lot of data, so it is recommended to be used only when necessary. Defaults to `false`.|`true` or `false`|\n|`appium:safariLogAllCommunicationHexDump`|Log all communication sent to and received from the Web Inspector, as raw hex dump and printable characters. This logging is done _before_ any data manipulation, and so can elucidate some communication issues. Like `appium:safariLogAllCommunication`, this can produce a lot of data in some cases, so it is recommended to be used only when necessary. Defaults to `false`.|`true` or `false`|\n|`appium:safariSocketChunkSize`|The size, in _bytes_, of the data to be sent to the Web Inspector on iOS 11+ real devices. Some devices hang when sending large amounts of data to the Web Inspector, and breaking them into smaller parts can be helpful in those cases. Defaults to `16384` (also the maximum possible)|e.g., `1000`|\n|`appium:safariWebInspectorMaxFrameLength`| The maximum size in bytes of a single data frame for the Web Inspector. Too high values could introduce slowness and/or memory leaks. Too low values could introduce possible buffer overflow exceptions. Defaults to 20MB (`20*1024*1024`) |e.g. `1024`, `100*1024*1024` |\n|`appium:additionalWebviewBundleIds`|Array (or JSON array) of possible bundle identifiers for webviews. This is sometimes necessary if the Web Inspector is found to be returning a modified bundle identifier for the app. Defaults to `[]`|e.g., `['io.appium.modifiedId', 'ABCDEF']`|\n|`appium:webviewConnectTimeout`|The time to wait, in `ms`, for the initial presence of webviews in MobileSafari or hybrid apps. Defaults to `0`|e.g., '5000'|\n|`appium:safariIgnoreWebHostnames`| Provide a list of hostnames (comma-separated) that the Safari automation tools should ignore. This is to provide a workaround to prevent a webkit bug where the web context is unintentionally changed to a 3rd party website and the test gets stuck. The common culprits are search engines (yahoo, bing, google) and `about:blank` |e.g. `'www.yahoo.com, www.bing.com, www.google.com, about:blank'`|\n|`appium:nativeWebTap` | Enable native, non-javascript-based taps being in web context mode. Defaults to `false`. Warning: sometimes the preciseness of native taps could be broken, because there is no reliable way to map web element coordinates to native ones. | `true` |\n|`appium:nativeWebTapStrict` | Enforce native taps to be done by XCUITest driver rather than WebDriverAgent. Only applicable if `nativeWebTap` is enabled. `false` by default | `false` |\n|`appium:safariInitialUrl`| Initial safari url, default is a local welcome page. Setting it to an empty string will skip the initial navigation. | e.g. `https://www.github.com` |\n|`appium:safariAllowPopups`| Allow javascript to open new windows in Safari. Default keeps current sim setting|`true` or `false`|\n|`appium:safariIgnoreFraudWarning`| Prevent Safari from showing a fraudulent website warning. Default keeps current sim setting.|`true` or `false`|\n|`appium:safariOpenLinksInBackground`| Whether Safari should allow links to open in new windows. Default keeps current sim setting.|`true` or `false`|\n|`appium:webviewConnectRetries`| Number of times to send connection message to remote debugger, to get webview. Default: `8` |e.g., `12`|\n|`appium:webkitResponseTimeout`| (Real device only) Set the time, in ms, to wait for a response from WebKit in a Safari session. Defaults to `5000`|e.g., `10000`|\n|`appium:enableAsyncExecuteFromHttps`| Capability to allow simulators to execute asynchronous JavaScript on pages using HTTPS. Defaults to `false` | `true` or `false` |\n|`appium:fullContextList` | Returns the detailed information on contexts for the [get available context](https://appium.io/docs/en/commands/context/get-contexts/index.html) command. If this capability is enabled, then each item in the returned contexts list would additionally include WebView title, full URL and the bundle identifier. Defaults to `false`. | `true` or `false` |\n|`appium:enablePerformanceLogging`| Enable Safari's performance logging (default `false`)| `true`, `false`|\n|`appium:autoWebview`| Move directly into Webview context if available. Default `false`|`true`, `false`|\n\n### Other\n\n|Capability|Description|Values|\n|----------|-----------|------|\n|`appium:resetOnSessionStartOnly`|Whether to perform reset on test session finish (`false`) or not (`true`). Keeping this variable set to `true` and Simulator running (the default behaviour since version 1.6.4) may significantly shorten the duration of test session initialization.|Either `true` or `false`. Defaults to `true`|\n|`appium:commandTimeouts`|Custom timeout(s) in milliseconds for WDA backend commands execution. This might be useful if WDA backend freezes unexpectedly or requires too much time to fail and blocks automated test execution. The value is expected to be of type string and can either contain max milliseconds to wait for each WDA command to be executed before terminating the session forcefully or a valid JSON string, where keys are internal Appium command names (you can find these in logs, look for \"Executing command 'command_name'\" records) and values are timeouts in milliseconds. You can also set the 'default' key to assign the timeout for all other commands not explicitly enumerated as JSON keys.|`'120000'`, `'{\"findElement\": 40000, \"findElements\": 40000, \"setValue\": 20000, \"default\": 120000}'`|\n|`appium:useJSONSource`|Get JSON source from WDA and transform it to XML on the Appium server side. Defaults to `false`.|e.g., `true`|\n|`appium:skipLogCapture`|Skips to start capturing logs such as crash, system, safari console and safari network. It might improve performance such as network. Log related commands will not work. Defaults to `false`. |`true` or `false`|\n|`appium:launchWithIDB`| Launch WebDriverAgentRunner with [idb](https://github.com/facebook/idb) instead of xcodebuild. This could save a significant amout of time by skiping the xcodebuild process, although the idb might not be very reliable, especially with fresh Xcode SDKs. Check the [idb repository](https://github.com/facebook/idb/issues) for more details on possible compatibility issues. Defaults to `false` |`true` or `false`|\n|`appium:showIOSLog`| Whether to show any logs captured from a device in the appium logs. Default `false`|`true` or `false`|\n|`appium:clearSystemFiles`|Whether to clean temporary XCTest files (for example logs) when a testing session is closed. `false` by default| `true` or `false`\n|`appium:newCommandTimeout`|How long (in seconds) the driver should wait for a new command from the client before assuming the client has stopped sending requests. After the timeout the session is going to be deleted. `60` seconds by default. Setting it to zero disables the timer. |e.g. `100`|\n\n## Element Attributes\n\nXCUITest driver supports the following element attributes:\n\nName | Description | Example\n--- | --- | ---\nname | Could contain either element's [identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielementattributes/1500981-identifier?language=objc) or its [label](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielementattributes/1500692-label?language=objc), depending on which one is available first. Could also be `null`. It is recommended to prefer the usage of [accessibilityIdentifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiaccessibilityidentification/1623132-accessibilityidentifier) over [accessibilityLabel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615181-accessibilitylabel) for automation purposes, since the `identifier` property is supposed to stay constant under different locales and does not affect accessibility services such as VoiceOver. | 'hello'\nlabel | Element's [label](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielementattributes/1500692-label?language=objc) value. Could be `null` | 'hello'\ntype | Element's [type](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielementattributes/1500614-elementtype?language=objc) name | 'XCUIElementTypeButton'\nvisible | Whether the element is visible. This value is not available in the \"vanilla\" XCTest and is read directly from the accessibility layer | 'false'\nfocused | Whether the element is [focused](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielementattributes/1627636-hasfocus?language=objc). *Only available for tvOS* | 'true'\naccessible | Whether the element is accessible. This value is not available in the \"vanilla\" XCTest and is read directly from the accessibility layer | 'true'\nenabled | Whether the element is [enabled](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielementattributes/1500330-enabled?language=objc). | 'false'\nselected | Whether the element is [selected](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielementattributes/1500581-selected?language=objc) | 'false'\nindex | Element's index in the hierarchy relatively to its parent. Only available since Appium 1.20.0. Indexing starts from `0`. | '2'\nrect | Element's rectangle. The actual data of this attribute is based on element's [frame](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielementattributes/1500911-frame?language=objc). | {'x': 0, 'y': 0, 'width': 100, 'height': 100}\nvalue | Element's value. This is a complex attribute, whose calculation algorithm depends on the actual element type. Check [WebDriverAgent sources](https://github.com/appium/WebDriverAgent/blob/master/WebDriverAgentLib/Categories/XCUIElement%2BFBWebDriverAttributes.m) to know more about how it is compiled (method `- (NSString *)wdValue`). Could be `null` | 'hello'\n\n\n## Opt-in Features (With Security Risk)\n\nThese can be enabled when running this driver through Appium, via the `--allow-insecure` or `--relaxed-security` flags.\n\n|Feature Name|Description|\n|------------|-----------|\n|shutdown_other_sims|Allow any session to use a capability to shutdown any running simulators on the host|\n|perf_record|Allow recording the system performance and other metrics of the simulator|\n|audio_record|Allow recording of host audio input(s)|\n|customize_result_bundle_path|Allow customization of paths to result bundles by `resultBundlePath` capability|\n\n\n## Settings API\n\nXCUITest driver supports Appium [Settings API](https://appium.io/docs/en/advanced-concepts/settings/).\nAlong with the common settings the following driver-specific settings are currently available:\n\nName | Type | Description\n--- | --- | ---\nelementResponseAttributes | string | Comma-separated list of element attribute names to be included into findElement response. By default only element UUID is present there, but it is also possible to add the following items: `name`, `text`, `rect`, `enabled`, `displayed`, `selected`, `attribute/<element_attribute_name>`. It is required that `shouldUseCompactResponses` setting is set to `false` in order for this one to apply.\nshouldUseCompactResponses | boolean | Used in combination with `elementResponseAttributes` setting. If set to `false` then the findElement response is going to include the items enumerated in `elementResponseAttributes` setting. `true` by default\nscreenshotQuality | int | See the description of the corresponding capability.\nmjpegServerFramerate | int | The maximum count of screenshots per second taken by the MJPEG screenshots broadcaster. Must be in range 1..60. `10` by default\nmjpegScalingFactor | int | The percentage value used to apply downscaling on the screenshots generated by the MJPEG screenshots broadcaster. Must be in range 1..100. `100` is by default, which means that screenshots are not downscaled.\nmjpegServerScreenshotQuality | int | The percentage value used to apply lossy JPEG compression on the screenshots generated by the MJPEG screenshots broadcaster. Must be in range 1..100. `25` is by default, which means that screenshots are compressed to the quarter of their original quality.\ncustomSnapshotTimeout (snapshotTimeout before 1.19.1) | float | Set how much time in float seconds is allowed to resolve a single accessibility snapshot with custom attributes. _Snapshots_ are mainly used for page source generation, XML lookup and custom attributes retrieval (these are visibility and accessibility ones). It might be necessary to increase this value if the actual page source is very large and contains hundreds of UI elements. Defaults to 15 seconds. Since Appium 1.19.1 if this timeout expires and no custom snapshot could be made then WDA tries to calculate the missing attributes using its own algorithms, so setting this value to zero might speed up, for example, page source retrieval, but for the cost of preciseness of some element attributes.\nwaitForIdleTimeout | float | Has the same meaning as corresponding capability (see above)\nanimationCoolOffTimeout | float | The amount of time in float seconds to wait until the application under test does not have any active animations. This check is usually applied after each automation action that is supposed to change the state of the application under test, like `click` one, and blocks XCTest until the transition of the tested application to a new state completes or the cool off timeout occurs. The default value is `2` (seconds). Setting it to zero disables animation checks completely.\nsnapshotMaxDepth | int | Changes the value of maximum depth for traversing elements source tree. It may help to prevent out of memory or timeout errors while getting the elements source tree, but it might restrict the depth of source tree. Please consider restricting this value if you observed an error like _Timed out snapshotting com.apple.testmanagerd..._ message or _Cannot get 'xml' source of the current application_ in your Appium log since they are possibly timeout related. A part of elements source tree might be lost if the value was too small. Defaults to `50`\nuseFirstMatch | boolean | Enabling this setting makes single element lookups faster, but there is the known [problem](https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/10101) related to nested elements lookup. Defaults to `false`.\nreduceMotion | boolean | Changes the 'reduce motion' preference of accessibility feature. Defaults to `false`\ndefaultActiveApplication | string | Sets the hint for active application selection. This helps WebDriverAgent to select the current application if there are multiple items in the active applications list and the desired one is also one of them. The setting is particularly useful for split-screen apps automation. Defaults to `auto`, which makes WebDriverAgent to select the application whose element is located at `screenPoint` location or a single item from the active apps list if the length of this list is equal to one.\nactiveAppDetectionPoint | string | Defines the coordinates of the current screen point. WebDriverAgent uses this point to detect the active application if multiple application are active on the screen. The format of this value is `x,y`, where x and y are float or integer numbers representing valid screen coordinates. Setting this value to a point outside the actual screen coordinates might corrupt WebDriverAgent functionality. By default the screen point coordinates equal to 20% of the minimum screen dimension each, e.g. `MIN(w, h) * 0.2, MIN(w, h) * 0.2`\nincludeNonModalElements | boolean | Whether returns all of elements including no modal dialogs on iOS 13+. It fixes [cannot find elements on nested modal presentations](https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/13227), but it might make visibility attributes unreliable. You could also enable `shouldUseTestManagerForVisibilityDetection` setting (defaults to `false`) or `simpleIsVisibleCheck` capability to improve the visibility detection. This issue may happen between iOS 13.0 to 13.2 (Xcode 11.0 to 11.2). The query issued in `includeNonModalElements` returns `nil` with newer iOS/Xcode versions and Appium/WDA return proper elements three without this setting being used. Defaults to `false`.\nacceptAlertButtonSelector | string | Allows to customize accept alert button selector. It helps you to handle an arbitrary element as accept button in `accept alert` command. The selector should be a valid [class chain](https://github.com/facebookarchive/WebDriverAgent/wiki/Class-Chain-Queries-Construction-Rules) expression, where the search root is the alert element itself. The default button location algorithm is used if the provided selector is wrong or does not match any element. Example: ```**/XCUIElementTypeButton[`label CONTAINS[c] 'accept'`]```\ndismissAlertButtonSelector | string | Allows to customize dismiss alert button selector. It helps you to handle an arbitrary element as dismiss button in `dismiss alert` command. The selector should be a valid [class chain](https://github.com/facebookarchive/WebDriverAgent/wiki/Class-Chain-Queries-Construction-Rules) expression, where the search root is the alert element itself. The default button location algorithm is used if the provided selector is wrong or does not match any element. Example: ```**/XCUIElementTypeButton[`label CONTAINS[c] 'dismiss'`]```\nscreenshotOrientation | string | Adjust screenshot orientation for iOS. Appium tries to return a screenshot and adjust its orientation properly using internal heuristics, but sometimes it does not work, especially in landscape mode. The actual screenshot orientation depends on various factors such as OS versions, model versions and whether this is a real or simulator device. This option allows you to enforce the given image orientation. Acceptable values: `auto` (default), `portrait`, `portraitUpsideDown`, `landscapeRight`, `landscapeLeft`.\nboundElementsByIndex | boolean | Whether to look up elements with [`allElementsBoundByAccessibilityElement`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielementquery/1500816-allelementsboundbyaccessibilitye) (default) or [`allElementsBoundByIndex`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielementquery/1500945-allelementsboundbyindex). [This Stack Overflow topic](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49307513/meaning-of-allelementsboundbyaccessibilityelement) explains the differences. Defaults to `false`.\nkeyboardAutocorrection | boolean | Changes the 'Auto-Correction' preference in _Keyboards_ setting. Defaults to `false`.\nkeyboardPrediction | boolean | Changes the 'Predictive' preference in _Keyboards_ setting. Defaults to `false`.\nnativeWebTap | boolean | See the description of the corresponding capability.\nnativeWebTapStrict | boolean | See the description of the corresponding capability.\nnativeWebTapTabBarVisibility | enum | Bypass finding whether the existence of the _**tab bar**_ before tapping on the element. It could make native web tap faster. If it's `visible`, tab bar offset will be added without checking the existence of the tab bar. It's `invisible`, the tab bar offset will be `zero`. If you want to leave Appium to check and measure the tab bar offset, unset or set `detect`. Only applicable if `nativeWebTap` and `nativeWebTapStrict` are enabled. Unset by default.\nnativeWebTapSmartAppBannerVisibility | enum | The same as `nativeWebTapTabBarVisibility`, this keyword will bypass finding whether the existence of the _**smart app banner**_.\nsafariTabBarPosition | string | Handle offset of Safari tab bar in `nativeWebTap` enabled interactions. If `platformVersion` was greater than or equal to 15 and iPhone device, the value is `bottom` by default. Otherwise `top`. When the value is `top`, Appium considers offset as the bar length. iOS 15+ environment can customize the bar position in the settings app, so please adjust the offset with this. Acceptable values: `bottom`, `top`\nuseJSONSource | boolean | See the description of the corresponding capability.\n\n## Element Location\n\nXCUITest driver supports the following location strategies in the native context:\n\nName | Description | Example\n--- | --- | ---\nid, name, accessibility id | All these locator types are synonyms and internally get transformed into search by element's `name` [attribute](#element-attributes). | `my name`\nclassName | Performs search by element's `type` [attribute](#element-attributes). The full list of supported XCUIElement type names could be found in the official XCTest [documentation on XCUIElementType](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielementtype) | `XCUIElementTypeButton`\n-ios predicate string | This strategy is mapped to the native XCTest predicate locator. Check the [NSPredicate cheat sheet](https://academy.realm.io/posts/nspredicate-cheatsheet/) for more details on how to build effective predicate expressions. All the supported element [attributes](#element-attributes) could be used in these expressions. | `(name == 'done' OR value == 'done') AND type IN {'XCUIElementTypeButton', 'XCUIElementTypeKey'}`\n-ios class chain | This strategy is mapped to the native XCTest predicate locator, but with respect to the actual element tree hierarchy. Such locators are basically a supertype of `-ios predicate string`. Read [Class Chain Queries Construction Rules](https://github.com/facebookarchive/WebDriverAgent/wiki/Class-Chain-Queries-Construction-Rules) for more details on how to build such locators. | ```**/XCUIElementTypeCell[$name == 'done' OR value == 'done'$]/XCUIElementTypeButton[-1]```\nxpath | For elements lookup using the Xpath strategy the driver uses the same XML tree that is generated by the page source API. This means such locators are the slowest (sometimes up to 10x slower) in comparison to the ones above, which all depend on native XCTest primitives, but are the most flexible. Use Xpath locators only if there is no other way to locate the given element. Only Xpath 1.0 is supported. | `//XCUIElementTypeButton[@value=\\\"Regular\\\"]/parent::*`\n\nAlso, consider checking the [How To Achieve The Best Lookup Performance](https://github.com/facebookarchive/WebDriverAgent/wiki/How-To-Achieve-The-Best-Lookup-Performance) article.\n\n\n## Parallel Tests\n\nIt is possible to execute tests in parallel using XCUITest driver.\nAppium allows to do this on per-process (multiple server processes running on different ports managing single session)\nor per-request basis (single server process managing multiple sessions, more preferable, uses less resources and ensures better control over running sessions).\n\n_Note_: If you are not going to run your tests in parallel then consider enabling the `--session-override` Appium server argument.\nIt forces the server to close all pending sessions before a new one could be opened,\nwhich allows you to avoid possible issues with such sessions silently running/expiring in the background.\n\n### Important Real Device Capabilities\n\n- `udid` must be a unique device UDID for each parallel session.\n- `wdaLocalPort` must be a unique port number for each parallel session. The default value is `8100`.\n- `derivedDataPath` set the unique derived data path root for each driver instance. This will help to avoid possible conflicts and to speed up the parallel execution.\n- `mjpegServerPort` must be a unique port number for each parallel session if you are going to record a video stream from it. The default value is `9100`.\n\n### Important Simulator Capabilities\n\n- Either `udid`, which is the unique simulator UDID for each parallel session (it could be retrieved from `xcrun simctl list` command output),\n  or a unique combination of `deviceName` and `platformVersion` capabilities to identify the appropriate simulator with the given name and version number for each parallel session.\n- `wdaLocalPort` must be a unique port number for each parallel session. The default value is `8100`.\n- `derivedDataPath` set the unique derived data path root for each driver instance. This will help to avoid possible conflicts and to speed up the parallel execution.\n- `mjpegServerPort` must be a unique port number for each parallel session if you are going to record a video stream from it. The default value is `9100`.\n\n\n## Platform-Specific Extensions\n\nBeside of standard W3C APIs the driver provides the following custom command extensions to execute platform specific scenarios:\n\n### mobile: selectPickerWheelValue\n\nPerforms selection of the next or previous picker wheel value. This might\nbe useful if these values are populated dynamically, so you don't know which\none to select or value selection suing `sendKeys` API does not work because of an XCTest bug. The method throws an exception if it fails to change the current picker value.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nName | Type | Required | Description | Example\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nelementId (`element` before version 1.22) | string | yes | PickerWheel's internal element id (as hexadecimal hash string) to perform value selection on. The element must be of type XCUIElementTypePickerWheel | abcdef12-1111-2222-3333-444444\norder | string | yes | Either `next` to select the value next to the current one from the target picker wheel or `previous` to select the previous one. | next\noffset | number | no | The value in range [0.01, 0.5]. It defines how far from picker wheel's center the click should happen. The actual distance is calculated by multiplying this value to the actual picker wheel height. Too small offset value may not change the picker wheel value and too high value may cause the wheel to switch two or more values at once. Usually the optimal value is located in range [0.15, 0.3]. `0.2` by default | 0.15\n\n### mobile: alert\n\nTries to apply the given action to the currently visible alert.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nName | Type | Required | Description | Example\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\naction | string | yes | The actual action to apply. Could be either: `accept`, `dismiss` or `getButtons` | accept\nbuttonLabel | string | no | The name of the button used to perform the chosen alert action. Only makes sense if the action is `accept` or `dismiss` | Accept\n\n#### Returned Result\n\nThe list of alert button names if the selected action is `getButtons`\n\n### mobile: setPasteboard\n\nSets the Simulator's pasteboard content to the given value. Does not work for real devices.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nName | Type | Required | Description | Example\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\ncontent | string | yes | The content to set | hello\nencoding | string | no | The content's encoding. `utf8` by default | ascii\n\n### mobile: getPasteboard\n\nGets the Simulator's pasteboard content. Does not work for real devices.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nName | Type | Required | Description | Example\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nencoding | string | no | The expected encoding of the returned string. `utf8` by default | ascii\n\n#### Returned Result\n\nThe pasteboard content string.\n\n### mobile: source\n\nAllows to retrieve the source tree of the current page in different representation formats.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nName | Type | Required | Description | Example\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nformat | string | yes | One of possible page tree source representation formats: `xml` (the default value), `description` and `json`. The `xml` format generates the output similar to what `getPageSource` standard API returns. `description` representation is how XCTest \"sees\" the page internally and is the same string as [debugDescription](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielement/1500909-debugdescription?language=objc) API would return for the root application element. This source representation format is useful for debugging purposes and is the fastest one to fetch. `json` representation is similar to `xml`, but the tree hierarchy there is represented as JSON elements tree rather than as XML nodes. | description\nexcludedAttributes | string | no | One or more comma-separated attribute names to be excluded from the XML output, thus only makes sense if `format` is set to `xml`. It might be sometimes helpful to exclude, for example, the `visible` attribute, to significantly speed-up page source retrieval. | visible,accessible\n\n#### Returned Result\n\nThe page source tree formatted according to the given format argument.\n\n### mobile: getContexts\n\nRetrieves the list of available contexts including the extended context information, like urls and page names. This is different from the standard `getContexts` API, because the latter only has web view names without any additional information. In situation where multiple web views are available at once the client code would have to connect to each of them in order to detect the one, which needs to be interacted with. Although, this extra effort is not needed with the information provided by this extension.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nName | Type | Required | Description | Example\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nwaitForWebviewMs | number | no | Tells Appium for how long (in milliseconds) to wait for web view(s) to appear. `5000`ms by default | 10000\n\n#### Returned Result\n\nThe list of available context objects along with their properties:\n\n- id: The identifier of the context. The native context will be 'NATIVE_APP' and the webviews will be 'WEBVIEW_xxx'\n- title: The title associated with the webview content. Could be `null`\n- url: The url associated with the webview content. Could be `null`\n\n### mobile: installApp\n\nInstalls the given application to the device under test.

If not provided then the value of `appium:appPushTimeout` capability is used. If the capability is not provided then equals to 240000ms | 500000\nstrategy | string | no | One of possible app installation strategies on real devices. This argument is ignored on simulators. If not provided then the value of `appium:appInstallStrategy` is used. If the latter is also not provided then `serial` is used. See the description of `appium:appInstallStrategy` capability for more details on available values. | parallel\n\n### mobile: isAppInstalled\n\nChecks whether the given application is installed on the device under test.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nName | Type | Required | Description | Example\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nbundleId | string | yes | The bundle identifier of the application to be checked | com.mycompany.myapp\n\n#### Returned Result\n\nEither `true` or `false`\n\n### mobile: removeApp\n\nRemoves the given application from the device under test.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nName | Type | Required | Description | Example\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nbundleId | string | yes | The bundle identifier of the application to be removed | com.mycompany.myapp\n\n#### Returned Result\n\nEither `true` if the app was successfully uninstalled, otherwise `false`\n\n### mobile: launchApp\n\nExecutes the given app on the device under test.

Having `UIFileSharingEnabled` set to `true` in the app properties map means this app supports files upload and download into its `documents` container. Read [Pushing/Pulling files](https://appium.io/docs/en/writing-running-appium/ios/ios-xctest-file-movement/) for more details.\n\n### mobile: startPerfRecord\n\nStarts performance profiling for the device under test.\nRelaxing security is mandatory for simulators. It can always work for real devices.\nSince XCode 12 the method tries to use `xctrace` tool to record performance stats.\nThe `instruments` developer utility is used as a fallback for this purpose if `xctrace` is not available. It is possible to record multiple profiles at the same time. Read [Instruments User Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/InstrumentsUserGuide/Recording,Pausing,andStoppingTraces.html) for more details.\nIf the recording for the given profile is already running then nothing is done.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nName | Type | Required | Description | Example\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\ntimeout | number | no | The maximum count of milliseconds to record the profiling information. It is recommended to always limit the maximum duration of perf record operation, since the resulting logs are pretty huge and may easily exceed the free space on th local storage volume. `300000`ms by default (5 minutes) | `600000`\nprofileName | string | no | The name of existing performance profile to apply. Can also contain the full path to the chosen template on the server file system. Note, that not all profiles are supported on mobile devices. `Activity Monitor` by default. | `Time Profile`\npid | string or number | no | The ID of the process to measure the performance for. Set it to `current` in order to measure the performance of the process, which belongs to the currently active application. All processes running on the device are measured if pid is unset (the default setting). | current\n\n### mobile: stopPerfRecord\n\nStops the performance recording operation previosuly started by `mobile: startPerfRecord` call. If the previous call has already been completed due to the timeout then its result is returned immediately. An error is thrown if the performance recording has failed to start and recorded no data.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nName | Type | Required | Description | Example\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nprofileName | string | no | The name of existing performance profile to stop the recording for. Multiple recorders for different profile names could be executed at the same time. `Activity Monitor` by default. | `Time Profile`\nremotePath | string | no | The path to the remote location, where the resulting zipped .trace file should be uploaded. The following protocols are supported: http/https, ftp Null or empty string value (the default setting) means the content of resulting file should be zipped, encoded as Base64 and passed as the endpoint response value. An exception will be thrown if the generated file is too big to fit into the available process memory. | https://myserver/upload\nuser | string | no | The name of the user for the remote authentication. Only works if `remotePath` is provided. | myuser\npass | string | no | The password for the remote authentication. Only works if `remotePath` is provided. | mypassword\nmethod | string | no | The http multipart upload method name.

Afterwards it is possible to unarchive and open such file with Xcode Developer Tools.\n\n### mobile: installCertificate\n\nInstalls a custom certificate onto the device. Since Xcode SDK 11.4 Apple has added a dedicated simctl subcommand to quickly handle certificates on Simulator over CLI.\nOn real devices the certificate could be installed via CLI if [py-ios-device](https://github.com/YueChen-C/py-ios-device) tool is available on the server machine.\nOn simulators before Xcode 11.4 SDK Apple provides no official way to do it via the command line. In such case (and also as a fallback if CLI setup fails) this method tries to wrap the certificate into .mobileconfig format and then deploys the wrapped file to the internal HTTP server, so one can open it via mobile Safari. Then the algorithm goes through the profile installation procedure by clicking the necessary buttons using WebDriverAgent.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nName | Type | Required | Description | Example\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\ncontent | string | yes | Base64-encoded content of the public certificate in [PEM](https://knowledge.digicert.com/quovadis/ssl-certificates/ssl-general-topics/what-is-pem-format.html) format | a23234...\ncommonName | string | no | Common name of the certificate. If this is not set then the script will try to parse it from the given certificate content. | com.myorg\nisRoot | boolean | no | This option defines where the certificate should be installed to: either Trusted Root Store (`true`, the default option) or the Keychain (`false`). On environments other than Xcode 11.4+ Simulator this option is ignored. | false\n\n#### Returned Result\n\nThe content of the generated .mobileconfig file as base64-encoded string. This config might be useful for debugging purposes. If the certificate has been successfully set via CLI then nothing is returned.\n\n### mobile: startLogsBroadcast\n\nStarts iOS system logs broadcast websocket on the same host and port where Appium server is running at `/ws/session/:sessionId:/appium/syslog` endpoint. The method will return immediately if the web socket is already listening.\nEach connected webcoket listener will receive syslog lines as soon as they are visible to Appium.\nRead [Using Mobile Execution Commands to Continuously Stream Device Logs with Appium](https://appiumpro.com/editions/55-using-mobile-execution-commands-to-continuously-stream-device-logs-with-appium) Appium Pro article for more details on this feature.\n\n### mobile: stopLogsBroadcast\n\nStops the syslog broadcasting wesocket server previously started by `mobile: startLogsBroadcast`. This method will return immediately if no server is running.\n\n### mobile: batteryInfo\n\nReads the battery information from the device under test. This endpoint only returns reliable result on real devices.\n\n#### Returned Result\n\nThe actual battery info map, which consists of the following entries:\n\n- level: Battery level in range [0.0, 1.0], where 1.0 means 100% charge.\n- state: Battery state as an integer number.

This method does not\naccept coordinates and simply emulates single swipe with one finger. It might be\nuseful for such cases like album pagination, switching views, etc. More advanced\ncases may require to call [mobile: dragFromToForDuration](#mobile-dragfromtoforduration),\nwhere one can supply coordinates and duration.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nName | Type | Required | Description | Example\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nelementId (\"element\" prior to Appium v 1.22) | string | no | The internal element identifier (as hexadecimal hash string) to swipe on. Application element will be used instead if this argument is not provided | fe50b60b-916d-420b-8728-ee2072ec53eb\ndirection | Either 'up', 'down', 'left' or 'right' | yes | The direction in which to swipe | up\nvelocity | number | no | This argument is optional and is only supported since Appium server version 1.19 and Xcode SDK version 11.4+. The value is measured in pixels per second and same values could behave differently on different devices depending on their display density. Higher values make swipe gesture faster (which usually scrolls larger areas if we apply it to a list) and lower values slow it down. Only values greater than zero have effect. | 250\n\n#### Examples\n\n```java\n// Java\nJavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;\nMap<String, Object> params = new HashMap<>();\nparams.put(\"direction\", \"down\");\nparams.put(\"velocity\", 2500);\nparams.put(\"element\", ((RemoteWebElement) element).getId());\njs.executeScript(\"mobile: swipe\", params);\n```\n\n#### References\n\n- [swipeDown](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielement/1618664-swipedown?language=objc)\n- [swipeDownWithVelocity:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielement/3551694-swipedownwithvelocity?language=objc)\n- [swipeUp](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielement/1618667-swipeup?language=objc)\n- [swipeUpWithVelocity:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielement/3551697-swipeupwithvelocity?language=objc)\n- [swipeLeft](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielement/1618668-swipeleft?language=objc)\n- [swipeLeftWithVelocity:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielement/3551695-swipeleftwithvelocity?language=objc)\n- [swipeRight](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielement/1618674-swiperight?language=objc)\n- [swipeRightWithVelocity:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielement/3551696-swiperightwithvelocity?language=objc)\n\n### mobile: scroll\n\nScrolls the element or the whole screen. Different scrolling strategies are supported.\nArguments define the choosen strategy: either 'name', 'direction', 'predicateString' or\n'toVisible' in that order. All strategies are exclusive and only one strategy\ncan be applied at a single moment of time. Use \"mobile: scroll\" to emulate precise\nscrolling in tables or collection views, where it is already known to which element\nthe scrolling should be performed. Although, there is one known limitation there: in case\nit is necessary to perform too many scroll gestures on parent container to reach the\nnecessary child element (tens of them) then the method call may fail.\n_Important_: The implemntation of this extension relies on several undocumented XCTest features, which might not always be reliable. Thus it might *not* always work as expected.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nName | Type | Required | Description | Example\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nelementId (\"element\" prior to Appium v 1.22) | string | no | The internal element identifier (as hexadecimal hash string) to scroll on (e.g. the container).

The same result can be achieved by setting _predicateString_ argument to 'name == accessibilityId'. Has no effect if _elementId_ is not a container | cell12\ndirection | Either 'up', 'down', 'left' or 'right' | yes | The main difference from [swipe](#mobile-swipe) call with the same argument is that _scroll_ will try to move the current viewport exactly to the next/previous page (the term \"page\" means the content, which fits into a single device screen) | down\npredicateString | string | no | The NSPredicate locator of the child element, to which the scrolling should be performed. Has no effect if _elementId_ is not a container | label == \"foo\"\ntoVisible | boolean | no | If set to _true_ then asks to scroll to the first visible _elementId_ in the parent container. Has no effect if _elementId_ is not set | true\n\n#### Examples\n\n```python\n# Python\ndriver.execute_script('mobile: scroll', {'direction': 'down'});\n```\n\n### mobile: pinch\n\nPerforms pinch gesture on the given element or on the application element.\n\n#### Arguments\n\nName | Type | Required | Description | Example\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nelementId (\"element\" prior to Appium v 1.22) | string | no | The internal element identifier (as hexadecimal hash string) to pinch on.

These include:\n\n* `REAL_DEVICE` - set to anything truthy, makes the tests use real device capabilities\n* `_FORCE_LOGS` - set to `1` to get the log output, not just spec\n* `PLATFORM_VERSION` - change the version to run the tests against (defaults to `9.3`)\n* `XCCONFIG_FILE` - specify where the xcode config file is for a real device run (if\n  blank, and running a real device test, it will search for the first file in\n  the root directory of the repo with the extension \"xcconfig\")\n* `UICATALOG_REAL_DEVICE` - path to the real device build of UICatalog, in case\n  the npm installed one is not built for real device\n\n\n"

At this point you have all the knowledge you'll need to be able to complete this stretch assignment.\n\n## **NOTE** This repository is to be used as a Stretch Assignment\n\n- [ ] Now that you have played around with Routing and have been building out some nested routes etc. It's time to get you into a little more practice. Remember that repetition is key.\n- [ ] The idea here is to build out a replica of Apple's navigation.\n- [ ] Build out a menu similar to the one on https://www.apple.com with a top level navigation.\n\n## Project\n\n- [ ] Use _create-react-app_ to make an application, name it `apple-nav`.\n- [ ] You'll need to build out a few components here. Some variation of a `NavWrapper` component which will be your navigation header.\n- [ ] Lastly you're going to need some sort of `SubNav` component, that will be reusable and display your sub-navigation links for each category.\n\n### Stretch Problem\n\n- [ ] Once you are finished with the Navigation and SubNavigation components you'll be able to look into ways to extend this application by adding some smooth transitions. Look into [this article](https://hackernoon.com/animated-page-transitions-with-react-router-4-reacttransitiongroup-and-animated-1ca17bd97a1a) for an example of how this can be achieved.\n\nThis example shows the sub-navigation for the `/mac` route.\n\n![Sample Navigation](images/sample.png)\n"

It also supports device simulators on both\nx86_64 and M1 hardware. This should enable the code to run on:\n\n* macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later, on:\n    * MacBook (including MacBooks using Apple Silicon)\n    * iMac (including iMacs using Apple Silicon)\n    * Mac Mini (including M1 Apple Silicon Mac minis)\n    * Mac Studio (all models)\n    * Mac Pro (all models)\n* iOS 13.0 or later, on:\n    * iPhone (6s or later)\n    * iPad (5th gen or later)\n    * iPad Air (all models)\n    * iPad Mini (2 or later)\n    * iPad Pro (all models)\n    * iPod Touch (7th gen or later)\n* tvOS 9.0 or later, on Apple TV (4th gen or later)\n* watchOS 4.0 or later, on Apple Watch (4th gen or later)\n\nQuickstart\n----------\n\nPre-built versions of the frameworks can be downloaded `for macOS`_, `for\niOS`_, `for tvOS`_, and `for watchOS`_, and added to your project.\n\nAlternatively, to build the frameworks on your own, download/clone this\nrepository, and then in the root directory, and run:\n\n* `make` (or `make all`) to build everything.\n* `make macOS` to build everything for macOS.\n* `make iOS` to build everything for iOS.\n* `make tvOS` to build everything for tvOS.\n* `make watchOS` to build everything for watchOS.\n\nThis should:\n\n1. Download the original source packages\n2. Patch them as required for compatibility with the selected OS\n3. Build the packages as XCode-compatible XCFrameworks.\n\nThe build products will be in the `build` directory; the compiled frameworks\nwill be in the `dist` directory.\n\n.. _for macOS: https://briefcase-support.org/python?platform=macOS&version=3.11\n.. _for iOS: https://briefcase-support.org/python?platform=iOS&version=3.11\n.. _for tvOS: https://briefcase-support.org/python?platform=tvOS&version=3.11\n.. _for watchOS: https://briefcase-support.org/python?platform=watchOS&version=3.11\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Windows Precision Touchpad Implementation for Apple MacBook family/Magic Trackpad 2\n\n[![Build Status](https://ligstd.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/build/definitions/7694e0d0-94e3-4fd2-b39a-ecd261e1ba2e/22/badge)](https://ligstd.visualstudio.com/Apple%20PTP%20Trackpad/_build?definitionId=22)\n\nThis project implements Windows Precision Touchpad Protocol for Apple MacBook family/Magic Trackpad 2 on Windows 10. Both USB (traditional and T2), SPI and Bluetooth trackpads are supported.\n\n## Donation?\n\nA few people asked me why I removed donation. My current financial situation doesn't require me to accept donation for the budget of future development. If you are considering donation, please consider other meaningful projects and foundations, such as [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/).\n\n## Official Driver?\n\nBootcamp 6.1.5 offers official driver for T2-based model and Magic Trackpad 2. You can also consider using the official driver if you have such Mac. If you have an older model (e.g. MacBooks before 2018/2019), this is the only implementation for these models (yet). \n\n## Future Plans and feature tracking\n\nUse the [Azure DevOps Board](https://ligstd.visualstudio.com/Apple%20PTP%20Trackpad/_workitems/) to track feature and device support plans. Bug reports should go to Github issues.\n\n## See it in action (YouTube video)\n\n[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/-GWlfw7omdo/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/-GWlfw7omdo)\n\n## Converged Installation Guide\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Given changes in Microsoft driver code signing policy, and the compliance need of EV certificate, CI auto builds beyond 2021/01/06 04:00AM EST will not be automatically signed with normal code signing certificate. These builds are still supposed via TestSigning, but not recommended for normal users. Proper WHQL and EV dual-signed packages will be released manually, which can be downloaded from the release page.\n\n0. Make sure you uninstalled `Trackpad++` completely if you have previously does so\n1. Go to the release tab in Github and download the newest version for your architecture\n2. Right click `AmtPtpDevice.inf` and install it\n3. If you have a Magic Trackpad 2 and want to use it in Bluetooth mode: manaully pair it in PC Settings.\n\n**Note: it is unnecessary to enable test signing, or install the certificate manually. Doing so may cause problems in installation. See [this issue](https://github.com/imbushuo/mac-precision-touchpad/issues/228#issuecomment-538689587) for detailed explanation.**\n\n## Also Uninstallation (extremely important for reinstallation `Trackpad++` and such)\n\nSee also [here](https://magicutilities.net/magic-trackpad/help/mac-precision-touchpad-driver-installed).\n\n1. Go to device manager\n2. Find the \"Apple Precision Touch Device\", \"Apple Multi-touch Trackpad HID filter\" and \"Apple Multi-touch Auxiliary Services\"\n3. Right click \"remove the device\" and also check \"uninstall driver\"\n4. Rescan devices\n\n## Installation with Chocolatey\n\nThe drivers are available as a [Chocolatey package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/mac-precision-touchpad/). To install using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) run:\n\n```\nchoco install mac-precision-touchpad\n```\n\n## For developers\n\n- SPI/T2 version is kernel-mode driver, using KMDF Framework v1.23. Bluetooth driver uses KMDF Framework 1.15. Windows 10 Driver Development Kit Version 2004 or higher is required for development and testing.\n- USB version is a user-mode driver, using UMDF Framework v2.15. Windows 10 Driver Development Kit Version 2004 or higher is required for development and testing.\n- `ReleaseSigned` configuration is reserved for production build only, and it will be rendered as unsigned if you attempt to build using that configuration. (Historically it's signed, but due to EV certificate's requirements, the process has changed.)\n\n## Device support\n\nThere is a bring-up issue for certain MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. I am looking into it. If you have such device with Windows installed, please contact me so I can look into the issue remotely (as I don't have many devices).\n\n- [x] Non-Retina MacBook \n- [x] Some non-Retina MacBook Pro (2011 and 2012)\n- [x] MacBook Pro with Retina Display (MacBookPro 10,1, MacBookPro10,2 & MacBookPro11,1)\n- [x] All recent MacBook Air (Please report if your model is not supported)\n- [x] MacBook Pro with Retina Display (2013, 2014, 2015, 13-inch & 15-inch)\n- [x] New MacBook (12-inch)\n- [x] MacBook Pro 2015, 2016, 2017 (a few SPI devices are in work-in-progress state)\n- [x] T2-based devices: MacBook Air 2018, MacBook Pro 2017/2018/2019/2020: Use default fallback, experience might not be optimal. Open a issue if you encountered dead touch regions.\n- [x] Magic Trackpad 2 & 3 (USB)\n- [x] Magic Trackpad 2 & 3 (Bluetooth connection)\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- [x] Touchpad Device Power Management\n- [x] Touchpad Protocol Stack Implementation\n- [x] Touchpad Raw Input Output (in Driver Trace)\n- [x] HID Protocol Implementation (PTP Touch)\n- [x] HID Protocol Implementation (Configuration)\n- [x] Device Test (Magic Trackpad 2)\n- [x] Refine input experience (tip switch detection and pressure)\n- [x] Refine input experience (gesture experience)\n- [x] More Models\n- [x] SPI\n- [x] KM Driver cross-cert\n- [x] Bluetooth\n- [ ] Defuzz\n- [ ] Input sensitivity configuration\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n**UPDATE 2021/05**: She got an M1 Mac now.\n\nPeople familiar with me know that I don't use Apple MacBook (so development work of this driver occurs on a Surface Pro 4). People probably think it doesn't make sense that I started this project. The motivation behind this project origin from complaints from my girlfriend. Hearing about frequent complains about Dell XPS 13's touchpad (though it passed Precision Touchpad certification), I decided to start this project, so by the time she switches to MacBook Pro, she will have excellent touchpad experience out-of-box, even on Windows. This driver is made for you, but also for everyone.\n\nI would like to thank projects like [magictrackpad2-dkms](https://github.com/robbi5/magictrackpad2-dkms) and [macbook12-spi-driver](https://github.com/cb22/macbook12-spi-driver) that inspire me. I would also like to thank my friends for providing me immense help on devices and testing.\n \n## License\n\n- USB driver is licensed under [GPLv2](LICENSE-GPL.md).\n- SPI driver is licensed under [MIT](LICENSE-MIT.md).\n\n"

The code and related resources are meant for\neducational purposes only. It is the responsibility of the user to make sure\nall local laws are adhered to.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nFirst you need to install some dependencies, for example on Ubuntu you would\nwrite:\n```\nsudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool\nsudo apt-get install libltdl-dev libao-dev libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev\nsudo apt-get install avahi-daemon\n```\n\n```\n./autogen.sh\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\nNotice that libao is required in order to install the shairplay binary,\notherwise only the library is compiled and installed.\n\n### Fairplay handshake support\n\nThe library has experimental support for handling fairplay handshake (used in\nfor example screen mirroring) using a playfair library that is licensed under\nGPLv3. This can be enabled by adding ```--with-playfair``` to the\n```./configure``` command above.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nCheck available options with ```shairplay --help```:\n\n```\nUsage: shairplay [OPTION...]\n\n  -a, --apname=AirPort            Sets Airport name\n  -p, --password=secret           Sets password\n  -o, --server_port=5000          Sets port for RAOP service\n      --ao_driver=driver          Sets the ao driver (optional)\n      --hwaddr=address            Sets the MAC address, useful if running multuple instances\n      --ao_devicename=devicename  Sets the ao device name (optional)\n      --ao_deviceid=id            Sets the ao device id (optional)\n  -h, --help                      This help\n```\n\nStart the server with ```shairplay```, if you are connected to a Wi-Fi the\nserver should show as an AirPort Express on your iOS devices and Mac OS X\ncomputers in the same network.\n\nNotice that you need to have the airport.key file in your working directory when\nstarting the shairplay service. It is not included in the binary for possible\nlegal reasons.\n\nMultiple Instances\n------------------\n\nShairplay advertises over mDNS in the form 485D607CEE22@Dining Room Speakers where 485D607CEE22 is a MAC address. This is hardcoded to a nonsense value, which is not a problem so long as it's unique. However, if you run multiple Shairplay instances, iOS devices will only recognize one of them. To fix this, supply the --hwaddr option with different values on each device.\n\nRelated software\n----------------\n\n* [ShairPort](https://github.com/abrasive/shairport), original AirPort Express emulator\n* [ALAC](http://craz.net/programs/itunes/alac.html), ALAC decoder by David Hammerton\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nShort description about what each file in the main library does:\n\n```\nsrc/lib/base64.*         - base64 encoder/decoder\nsrc/lib/dnssd.*          - dnssd helper functions\nsrc/lib/http_parser.*    - HTTP parser from joyent (nginx fork)\nsrc/lib/http_request.*   - Request parser that uses http_parser\nsrc/lib/http_response.*  - Extremely simple HTTP response serializer\nsrc/lib/httpd.*          - Generic HTTP/RTSP server\nsrc/lib/logger.*         - Logging related functions\nsrc/lib/netutils.*       - Mostly socket related code\nsrc/lib/raop.*           - Main RAOP handler, handles all RTSP stuff\nsrc/lib/raop_rtp.*       - Handles the RAOP RTP related stuff (UDP/TCP)\nsrc/lib/raop_buffer.*    - Parses and buffers RAOP packets, resend logic here\nsrc/lib/rsakey.*         - Decrypts and parses the RSA key to bigints\nsrc/lib/rsapem.*         - Converts the RSA PEM key to DER encoded bytes\nsrc/lib/sdp.*            - Extremely simple RAOP specific SDP parser\nsrc/lib/utils.*          - Utils for reading a file and handling strings\n```\n\nShort description about what each file in the Qt application does:\n\n```\nAirTV-Qt/main.cpp                 - Initializes the application\nAirTV-Qt/mainapplication.cpp      - Creates the tray icon and starts RAOP\nAirTV-Qt/raopservice.cpp          - Handles all communication with the library\nAirTV-Qt/raopcallbackhandler.cpp  - Converts C callbacks to Qt callbacks\nAirTV-Qt/audiooutput.cpp          - Takes care of the actual audio output\n```\n\n"

  "readme_contents": "# applepie, a hypervisor implementation for Bochs\r\n\r\nHello! Welcome to applepie! This is a tool designed for fuzzing, introspection, and finding bugs! This is a hypervisor using the Windows Hypervisor Platform API present in recent versions of Windows (specifically this was developed and tested on Windows 10 17763). Bochs is used for providing deep introspection and device emulation.\r\n\r\nThe Windows Hypervisor Platform API (WHVP) is an API set for accessing Hyper-V's hypervisor abilities. This API makes it easy for us to implement a virtual machine all in user-space without any special drivers or permissions needed.\r\n\r\n# Follow me on Twitter for updates\r\n\r\nThis is a rapidly developing project. I'll probably tweet when new features go out before they get documented.\r\n\r\n[@gamozolabs](https://twitter.com/gamozolabs)\r\n\r\n# Recent Feature Demo\r\n\r\n[![Youtube Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/qErEb5h9CwA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErEb5h9CwA)\r\n\r\n# Binary Coverage Example\r\n\r\n[![Youtube Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/S1D433EwktE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1D433EwktE)\r\n\r\n# Mascot\r\n\r\nI like to have physical things for my projects:\r\n\r\n[apple pie squishable](http://www.squishable.com/pc/comfortfood_apple_pie/comfort_food/Comfort+Food+Apple+Pie)\r\n\r\n# What is this for?\r\n\r\nThis is a tool designed for fuzzing and introspection during security research. By using a hypervisor common fuzzing techniques can be applied to any target, kernel or userland. This environment allows fuzzing of whole systems without a need for source of the target. At the hypervisor level code coverage can be gathered, and if needed Bochs emulation can be used to provide arbitrary introspection in an emulation environment. This coverage information can be used to figure out the effectiveness of the fuzz cases. A fuzz case that caused an increase in coverage can be saved as it was an interesting case. This input can be used later, built on by new corruptions.\r\n\r\nSnapshot fuzzing is the primary use of this tool. Where you take a snapshot of a system in a certain state, and save it off. This snapshot can then be loaded up for fuzzing, where a fuzz case is injected, and it's resumed. Since the VM can be reset very cheaply, the VM can be reset often. If it takes Word 5 seconds to boot, but you can snapshot it right as it reads your file, you can cut the fuzz case down to only what is relevant to an input. This allows for a very tight loop of fuzzing without needing to have access to source. Since the VM's are entirely separate systems, many can be run in parallel to allow scaling to all cores.\r\n\r\nCurrently this tool only supports gathering code coverage, dynamic symbol downloading for Windows, and symbol/module parsing for Windows targets as well. Adding fuzzing support will be quite soon.\r\n\r\n# Development cycle\r\n\r\nGiven I've written almost all the features here before (coverage, fuzzing, fast resets, etc). I expect this project should pretty quickly become ready for fuzzing, unless I get distracted :D\r\n\r\nI'm aiming for end-of-January for coverage (done!), feedback, module listings (done!), process lists, fast resets, and symbol support (done!). Which would make it a very capable fuzzer.\r\n\r\n# OS Support\r\n\r\nThe main supported target is modern Windows 10. Windows targets have downloading of symbols from the symbol store. This allows for symbolic coverage in Windows targets out of the box. However, the code is written in a way that Linux enlightenment can easily be added.\r\n\r\nWithout any enlightment, any OS that boots can still be fuzzed and basic coverage can be gathered.\r\n\r\nBefore reporting OS support issues please validate that the issue is in the hypervisor/changes to Bochs by trying to boot your target using standard prebuilt Bochs with no hypervisor. Bochs is not commonly used and can frequently have breaking bugs for even common things like booting Linux. Especially with the rapid internal changes to CPUID/MSR usages with Spectre/Meltdown mitigations going into OSes.\r\n\r\n# Issues\r\n\r\nSee the issues page on Github for a list of issues. I've seeded it with a few already. Some of these need to be addressed quickly before fuzzing development starts.\r\n\r\n# Building\r\n\r\n## Build Prereqs\r\n\r\nTo build this you need a few things:\r\n\r\n- Recently updated MSVC compiler (Visual Studio 2017)\r\n- Nightly Rust (https://rustup.rs/ , must be nightly)\r\n- Python (I used 3 but 2 should work too)\r\n- 64-bit cygwin with autoconf and GNU make packages installed\r\n- Hyper-V installed and a recent build of Windows 10\r\n\r\n#### MSVC\r\n\r\nInstall Visual Studio 2017 and make sure it's updated. We're using some bleeding edge APIs, headers, and libraries here.\r\n\r\nI was using `cl.exe` version: `Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.16.27025.1 for x64`\r\nAnd SDK version `10.0.17763.0`\r\n\r\n#### Nightly Rust\r\n\r\nInstall Rust via https://rustup.rs/. I used `rustc 1.32.0-nightly (b3af09205 2018-12-04)`\r\n\r\nMake sure you install the `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` toolchain as only 64-bit is supported for this project.\r\n\r\nMake sure `cargo` is in your path. This should be the default.\r\n\r\n#### Python\r\n\r\nGo grab python https://www.python.org/ and make sure it's in your PATH such that `python` can be invoked.\r\n\r\n#### Cygwin\r\n\r\nInstall 64-bit Cygwin (https://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe) specifically to `C:\\cygwin64`. When installing Cygwin make sure you install the `autoconf` and `make` packages.\r\n\r\n#### Hyper-V\r\n\r\nGo into \"Turn Windows features on or off\" and tick the checkbox next to \"Hyper-V\" and \"Windows Hypervisor Platform\". This requires of course that your computer supports Hyper-V.\r\n\r\n## Step-by-step build process\r\n\r\nThis install process guide was verified on the following:\r\n```\r\nClean install of Windows 10, Build 17763\r\nrustc 1.33.0-nightly (8e2063d02 2019-01-07)\r\nMicrosoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.16.27025.1 for x64\r\nVisual Studio Community 2017 version 15.9.4\r\napplepie commit `f84c084feb487e2e7f31f9052a4ab0addd2c4cf9`\r\nPython 3.7.2 x64\r\ngit version 2.20.1.windows.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Make sure Windows 10 is fully up to date\r\n\t- We use some bleeding edge features with WHVP and only latest Windows 10 is tested\r\n- In \"Turn Windows features on or off\"\r\n\t- Tick \"Hyper-V\"\r\n\t- Tick \"Windows Hypervisor Platform\"\r\n\t- Click ok to install and reboot\r\n\r\n![windows features](assets/winfeatures.png)\r\n\r\n- Install VS Community 2017 and updated\r\n\t- Desktop development with C++\r\n\r\n![vsconfig](assets/vsconfig.png)\r\n\r\n- Install Rust nightly for x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\r\n![rustconfig](assets/rustconfig.png)\r\n![rust installed](assets/rust_installed.png)\r\n- Install Git\r\n\t- Configure git to checkout as-is, commit unix-style\r\n\t- If git converts on checkout the ./configure script will fail for Bochs due to CRLF line endings\r\n\t- This is core.autocrlf=input\r\n\t- You can also use checkout as-is, commit as-is\r\n\t- This is core.autocrlf=false\r\n- Install Cygwin x64 via setup-x86_64.exe\r\n\t- Install to \"C:\\cygwin64\"\r\n\t- Install autoconf package (`autoconf` package)\r\n\t- Install GNU make (`make` package)\r\n- Install Python\r\n\t- I installed Python 3 x64 and added to PATH\r\n\t- Python 2 and 32-bit versions should be fine, we just use Python for our build script\r\n- Open a \"x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017\"\r\n- Checkout applepie via `git clone https://github.com/gamozolabs/applepie`\r\n- cd into applepie\r\n- Run `python build.py`\r\n\t- This will first check for some basic system requirements\r\n\t- It will build the Rust bochservisor DLL\r\n\t- It will then configure Bochs via autoconf\r\n\t- It will then build Bochs with GNU make from Cygwin\r\n\r\nThis initial build process may take about 2 minutes, on a modern machine it's likely 20-30 seconds.\r\n\r\n## Actually Building\r\n\r\nJust run `python build.py` from the root directory of this project. It should check for sanity of the environment and everything should \"just work\".\r\n\r\n## Cleaning\r\n\r\nRun `python build.py clean` to clean Bochs and Rust binaries.\r\n\r\nRun `python build.py deepclean` to completely remove all Bochs and Rust binaries, it also removes all the configuration for Bochs. Use this if you reconfigure Bochs in some way.\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\nRead up on Bochs configuration to figure out how to set up your environment. We have a few requirements, like `sync=none`, `ips=1000000`, and currently single processor support only. These are enforced inside of the code itself to make sure you don't shoot yourself in the foot.\r\n\r\nUse the included `bochservisor_test\\bochsrc.bxrc` and `bochservisor_test_real\\bochsrc.bxrc` configurations as examples. `bochservisor_test_real` is likely the most up to date config you should look at as reference.\r\n\r\n# Coverage\r\n\r\nWindows targets have module list enlightenment, which allows us to see the listings for all the modules in the context we are running in. With this we can convert the instruction addresses to module + offset. This module + offset helps keep coverage information between fuzz cases where ASLR state changes. It also allows for the module to be colored in a tool like IDA to visually see what code has been hit.\r\n\r\nFor Windows targets, symbols will be dynamically downloaded from the symbol store using your `_NT_SYMBOL_PATH` and using `symchk`. Without `symchk` in the path it will silently fail. With symbols a nice human-readable version of coverage can be saved for viewing. Further, with private symbols the coverage can be converted to source:line such that source code can be colored.\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n\r\nOkay there aren't really tests, but there's `bochservisor_test` which is a tiny OS that just verifies that everything boots with the hypervisor.\r\n\r\nThere's then `bochservisor_test_real` which is a configuration I use for things like Windows/Linux. This is the one that will probably get updated most frequently.\r\n\r\n# Architecture\r\n\r\n## Basics\r\n\r\nThis codebase introduces a small amount of code to Bochs to allow modular access to CPU context, guest physical to their backing memory, and stepping both device and CPU state.\r\n\r\nThe main code you want to look at is in `lib.rs` in the `bochservisor` Rust project.\r\n\r\n## CPU Loop\r\n\r\nIn the main CPU loop of Bochs we instead `LoadLibrary()` to load the `bochservisor` DLL. This DLL exports one routine which is the Rust CPU loop which will be invoked.\r\n\r\nBochs will pass a structure to this `bochs_cpu_loop` routine which will contain function pointers to get information from Bochs and to step the device and CPU state in it.\r\n\r\n## MMIO / I/O\r\n\r\nWhen MMIO or I/O occurs, the hypervisor will exit with a memory fault or an I/O instruction fault. While WHVP does provide an emulation API it's really lacking and not sufficient.\r\n\r\nRather we use Bochs which is already there and step through a few instructions. By keeping the hypervisor CPU state in sync with Bochs we can dynamically switch between hypervisor and emulation at any time (or at least we should be able to).\r\n\r\nThis means that the full hypervisor state is always in sync with Bochs and thus things like Bochs snapshots should work as normal and could be booted without the hypervisor (except maybe some CPUID state which needs to be stored in the snapshot info).\r\n\r\nWhen MMIO or I/O occurs we run a certain number of instructions under emulation rather than just emulating one. Due to the API costs of entering and exiting the hypervisor, and the likelihood that similar MMIO operations occur next to others, we step a few instructions. This allows use to reduce the overhead of the API and reduces the VMEXIT frequency. This is a tunable number but what is in the codebase is likely there for a reason.\r\n\r\n## Interrupts\r\n\r\nInterrupts we handle in a really interesting way. Rather than scheduling interrupts to be delivered to the hypervisor we handle _all_ interrupts in Bochs emulation itself. Things like exceptions that happen inside of the hypervisor entirely of course are not handled by Bochs.\r\n\r\nThis also gives us features that WHVP doesn't support, like SMIs (for SMM). Bochs's BIOS uses SMM by default and without SMI support a custom BIOS needs to be built. I did this in my first iteration of this... do not recommend.\r\n\r\n# Future\r\n\r\nThis project is designed for fuzzing, however it's so new (only a few days old) that it has none of these features.\r\n\r\nSome of the first things to come will be:\r\n\r\n## Evaluate threading\r\n\r\nWe could potentially have Bochs device stuff running in one thread in a loop in real-time, and another thread running the hypervisor. Async events would be communicated via IPC and would allow for the devices to be updated while execution is in the guest.\r\n\r\nCurrently everything happens in one thread which means the hypervisor must exit on an interval to make sure we can step devices. It's as if we wrote our own scheduler.\r\n\r\nThis might be a bit faster, but it also increases complexity and adds the potential for race issues. It's hard to say if this will ever happen.\r\n\r\n## Code coverage\r\n\r\nI'm not sure which method I'll use to gather code coverage, but there will be at least a few options. Spanning from accurate, to fast, etc. All these coverage mechanisms will be system level and will not require source or symbols of targets.\r\n\r\n## Guest enlightenment\r\n\r\nParsing of OS structures to get primitive information such as process listings, module lists, etc. This would then be used to query PDBs to get symbol information.\r\n\r\n## Crash reporting\r\n\r\nReporting crashes in some meaningful way. Ideally minidumps would be nice as they could be loaded up and processed in WinDbg. This might be fairly easy as DMPs are just physical memory and processor context, which we already have.\r\n\r\n## Crash deduping / root causing\r\n\r\nI've got some fun techniques for root causing bugs which have been historically successful. I plan to bring those here.\r\n\r\n## Fast resets\r\n\r\nBy tracking dirty pages and restoring only modified things we should be able to reset VMs very quickly. This gives us the ability to fuzz at maximum speeds on all cores of a system target. This is similar to what I did in falkervisor so it's already thought out and designed. It just needs to be ported here.\r\n\r\n## falkervisor mode\r\n\r\nExtremely fast fuzzing that cancels execution when MMIO or I/O occurs. This allows all the CPU time to be spent in the hypervisor and no emulation time. This has a downside of not supporting things like disk I/O during a fuzz case, but it's nice.\r\n\r\n# Philosophy\r\n\r\nSome of the core concepts of this project are absolute minimum modifications to Bochs. This allows us to keep the Bochs portion of this repo up to date.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to also move as much code into Rust and dlls as possible to make the system much more modular and safe. This will hopefully reduce the chances of making silly corruption bugs in the hypervisor itself, causing invalid fuzz results.\r\n\r\nCurrently the hypervisor is a DLL and can be swapped out without changes to Bochs (unless the FFI API changes).\r\n\r\nFurther changes to Bochs itself must be documented clearly, and I'll be making a document for that shortly to track the changes to Bochs which must be ported and re-evaluated with Bochs updates.\r\n"

(you may need this signed with your payment processing partner's csr rather than your own - e.g. Stripe.com )\n\n* have you got a Merchant (session) certificate from apple (using your own csr & private key)\n\n \nhere's how to do the last bit..\n* Go here https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifier/merchant\n* click + to create a merchant ID if you haven't already done so. If you have one already, click it, then click \"edit\"\n* on the next screen you have 3 things to do.\n* 1 create a Payment Processing Certificate (use your 3rd party payment provider's csr for this)\n* 2 add a Merchant Domain\n* 3 create an Apple Pay Merchant Identity (which is another certificate).\n\nIn that third section \"Apple Pay Merchant Identity\"...\n\n* Click \"Create Certificate\"\n* Follow the \"Create a CSR file. (Optional)\" method then hit \"Continue\"\n* You'll see at the top of the next page that the act of using KeychainAccess.app to create a CSR, actually creates a private key and certificate (aka public key) pair. These are both kept in keychainaccess.app on your mac. The public key/cert is also saved to disk when you create it, it's this xxx.certSigningRequest file which you'll upload to apple next\n* Once you upload your public key ( xxx.certSigningrequest file), apple will use it to generate your Apple Pay Merchant Identity (certificate) - a file called merchant_id.cer\n* download this merchant_id.cer file, and double-click it to insert it into keychain access.app. this should automatically get appended to the existing entry for your Private key in keychain access.app\n* right-click that certificate (probably named \"Merchant ID: merchant....\" from within keychain access.app (you may need to expand the private key entry to see the certificate under it) and select \"Export 'Merchant ID merchant....' \". This will default to exporting a xxxx.p12 file to your desktop.\n\nit's this xxx.p12 file which you then use openssl in terminal.app on your mac ......\n \nopenssl pkcs12 -in ApplePayMerchantIdentity_and_privatekey.p12 -out ApplePay.crt.pem -clcerts -nokeys  \nopenssl pkcs12 -in ApplePayMerchantIdentity_and_privatekey.p12 -out ApplePay.key.pem -nocerts \n\n...to create two .pem files. Remember the password you're asked to create when you extract ApplePay.key.pem above. You'll need to add this to apple_pay_conf.php. These are the two files your webserver will use to authenticate its conversations with Apple, requesting a session etc for each ApplePay transaction your customers make. \n\nIf at all possible, keep these two .pem files outside your root/public web folder. e.g. if your root web folder is /var/www/html/ then store these in /var/www/applepay_includes and include(); them in your php script.\n\nThroughout index.php I've sprinkled loads of console.log(). Plug your iphone into your Mac, goto your applepay test page on safari on your iPhone. Goto Safari on your Mac and select your iPhone from the Develop menu in Safari - voila - you now see what your phone's safari browser is telling you via the javascript console.\n\nIf you don't see your connected iPhone in the develop menu in safari on your Mac then it may not have been enabled. On the iPhone, go to Settings > safari > advanced  > web inspector > enable\n\nMake sure safari on the iphone is the active app, then, on the connected (with a cable) mac go to Safari > develop > {your iPhone}\n\nRemove the logit() lines in index.php (or set debug to false in apple_pay_conf.php) once you see how it all works and before you go-live with it.\n"

The apps (for both iOS and Android) use Bluetooth technology to exchange anonymous encrypted data with other mobile phones (on which the app is also installed) in the vicinity of an app user's phone. The data is stored locally on each user's device, preventing authorities or other parties from accessing or controlling the data. This repository contains the **native Android implementation** of the Corona-Warn-App.\n**Visit our [FAQ page](https://www.coronawarn.app/en/faq/) for more information and common issues**\n\n## Known Issues\n\n* The Exposure Notification API is going to block you from successfully testing the Application unless you are whitelisted inside GMS; **Shoutout to @pocmo for working on a demo mode to test unreleased app versions in advance without whitelisting (issue [#321](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-android/issues/321))**, if you want to contribute you can reach out [here](https://github.com/pocmo/cwa-app-android) for the time being - thank you!\n* The Storage is currently based on Encrypted Shared Preferences and SQL Cipher (SQLite) - this could change in the future\n* Test Coverage is generally low and needs to be improved. We appreciate your help here!\n* In General every TODO comment within the code or the documentation can be regarded as an issue. You are free to tackle the TODOs anytime!\n* We are aware of the Play Store Limitations of GMS.\n* Without your own server instance (e.g. a local Docker setup), you will not be able to test the Application. For help, please refer to the [server implementation](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-server).\n* Strings including translations are handled separately, for suggestions / findings please have a look at issue [#332](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-android/issues/332)\n\n## Architecture & Documentation\n\nThe full documentation for the Corona-Warn-App is in the [cwa-documentation](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation) repository.

  "repo": "stripe-archive/ApplePayStubs",
  "language": "Objective-C",
  "readme_contents": "ApplePayStubs\n===\n\nFirst, some big news!\n---\nThis library exists because as of iOS8 it was impossible to display a `PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController` (a.k.a. an Apple Pay payment sheet) in the iOS simulator. Fortunately, this is no longer necessary - as of iOS 9, Apple Pay works in the simulator, and returns dummy test cards. In other words, ApplePayStubs has been [sherlocked](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sherlocked)! As such, consider this library deprecated as of iOS 9. If you're interested in using it until the iOS 9 / Xcode 7 release, though, read on!\n\nWhat is this?\n---\n\nApplePay is awesome. However, since it isn't available in every country yet, and only then on the newest iOS devices, we want to make it easier for developers to plan and test their Apple Pay integrations.\n\nWe've created a replacement component for `PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController` (the primary class involved in ApplePay transactions) for businesses interested in working with ApplePay called `STPTestPaymentAuthorizationViewController`. These classes appear visually similar and behave almost identically. The primary difference is that `STPTestPaymentAuthorizationViewController` yields test credit cards and addresses instead of accessing actual information stored on a user's iPhone. You can use it to build and test all of your UI and application logic around ApplePay, and switch it out for the real thing once you have access to a proper testing device.\n\nPlease note that this is for **testing and development purposes only**.\n\nDependencies\n---\n- Xcode 6+\n- iOS 8+\n\nApplePayStubs also depends on the `PassKit` framework.\n\nInstallation\n---\nUse Cocoapods or manually add the files to your repository.\n\nUsage\n---\n\nYou create and use instances of `STPTestPaymentAuthorizationViewController` exactly the same way as with \n`PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController`.\n\n```objc\n// ViewController.m\n- (void)checkoutButtonTapped {\n    PKPaymentRequest *request = ...;\n    UIViewController *controller;\n#if DEBUG\n    controller = [[STPTestPaymentAuthorizationViewController alloc] initWithPaymentRequest:request];\n    controller.delegate = self;\n#else\n    controller = [[PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController alloc] initWithPaymentRequest:request];\n    controller.delegate = self;\n#endif\n\n    [self presentViewController:controller];\n}\n```\n\n`STPTestPaymentAuthorizationViewController` will trigger the same `PKPaymentAuthorizationViewControllerDelegate` callbacks at the appropriate time on its delegate.\n\n```objc\n- (void)paymentAuthorizationViewController:(PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController *)controller\n                  didSelectShippingAddress:(ABRecordRef)address\n                                completion:(void (^)(PKPaymentAuthorizationStatus status, NSArray *shippingMethods, NSArray *summaryItems))completion {\n    [self fetchShippingCostsForAddress:address completion:^(NSArray *shippingMethods, NSError *error) {\n        if (error) {\n            completion(PKPaymentAuthorizationStatusFailure, nil, nil);\n            return;\n        }\n        completion(PKPaymentAuthorizationStatusSuccess, shippingMethods, [self summaryItemsForShippingMethod:shippingMethods.firstObject]);\n    }];\n}\n\n- (void)paymentAuthorizationViewController:(PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController *)controller\n                   didSelectShippingMethod:(PKShippingMethod *)shippingMethod\n                                completion:(void (^)(PKPaymentAuthorizationStatus, NSArray *summaryItems))completion {\n    completion(PKPaymentAuthorizationStatusSuccess, [self summaryItemsForShippingMethod:shippingMethod]);\n}\n\n- (void)paymentAuthorizationViewControllerDidFinish:(PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController *)controller {\n    [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];\n}\n```\n\nWhen the user finishes selecting a card, as usual `STPTestPaymentAuthorizationViewController` will call `paymentAuthorizationViewController:didAuthorizePayment:completion` on its delegate.\n This delegate method includes a `PKPayment` object, which itself has an instance of `PKPaymentToken` that contains encrypted credit card data that you'd pass off to your payment processor (such as Stripe). While the `PKPayment` and `PKPaymentToken` returned by ApplePayStubs have stubbed (and invalid) versions of this data, the Stripe API will be able to recognize them in testmode. As such, you shouldn't have to modify your existing `PKPaymentAuthorizationViewControllerDelegate` methods:\n\n```objc\n- (void)paymentAuthorizationViewController:(PKPaymentAuthorizationViewController *)controller\n                       didAuthorizePayment:(PKPayment *)payment\n                                completion:(void (^)(PKPaymentAuthorizationStatus))completion {\n                                \n    [[STPAPIClient sharedClient] createTokenWithPayment:payment\n        completion:^(STPToken *token, NSError *error) {\n            [self createBackendChargeWithToken:token\n                                    completion:^(STPBackendChargeResult status, NSError *error) {\n                if (status == STPBackendChargeResultSuccess) {\n                    completion(PKPaymentAuthorizationStatusSuccess);\n                } else {\n                    completion(PKPaymentAuthorizationStatusFailure);\n                }\n        }];\n    }];\n}\n```\n\n(Note: Stripe tokens created from Apple Pay work interchangeably with those created using manually-collected credit card details).\n\nIf you're not using Stripe, you can find the selected card information on the `PKPayment`'s `PKPaymentToken` in the `transactionIdentifier` field, in the format `\"ApplePayStubs~{card_number}~{amount_in_cents}~{currency}~{uuid}\"`.\n\nExample App / Learn More\n---\n\nIf you'd like to see more examples of how to use this, we use ApplePayStubs in the [example app](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/tree/master/Example) for our [main iOS library](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios).\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about accepting payments on iOS with Stripe in general, read our [iOS tutorial](https://stripe.com/docs/mobile/ios).\n"

path/to/ipa\n\nSigning methods\n---------------\n\nThere are different ways to sign an IPA file with applesign for experimental reasons.\n\nYou may want to check the following options:\n\n**-c, --clone-entitlements**\n\nput the entitlements embedded inside the signed mobileprovisioning file provided by the user as the default ones to sign all the binaries\n\n**-S, --self-sign-provision**\n\ncreates a custom mobileprovisioning (unsigned for now). installd complains\n\n**-E, --entry-entitlement**\n\nuse the default entitlements plist. useful when troubleshooting\n\nThe default signing method does as follow:\n\n* Grab entitlements from binary\n* Remove problematic entitlements\n* Grab entitlements from the provisioning\n* Adjust application-id and team-id of the binary with the provisioning ones\n* Copy the original mobileprovisioning inside the IPA\n* Creates ${AppName}.entitlements and signs all the mach0s\n\nAfter some testing we will probably go for having -c or -E as default.\n\nIn addition, for performance reasons, applesign supports -p for parallel signing. The order of signing the binaries inside an IPA matters, so applesign creates a dependency list of all the bins and signs them in order. The parallel signing aims to run in parallel as much tasks as possible without breaking the dependency list.\n\nMangling\n--------\n\nIt is possible with `--force-family` to remove the UISupportedDevices from the Info.plist and replace the entitlement information found in the mobileprovisioning and then carefully massage the rest of entitlements to drop the privileged ones (`--massage-entitlements`).\n\nOther interesting manipulations that can be done in the IPA are:\n\n**-I, --insert [frida.dylib]**\n\nAllows to insert a dynamic library in the main executable. This is how Frida can be injected to introspect iOS applications without jailbreak.\n\n**-l, --lipo [arm64|armv7]**\n\nThinifies an IPA by removing all fatmach0s to only contain binaries for one specified architecture. Also this is helpful to identify non-arm binaries embedded inside IPA that can be leaked from development or pre-production environments.\n\nIn order to thinify the final IPA even more, applesign allows to drop the watchapp extensions which would not be necessary for non Apple Watch users.\n\nPerformance\n-----------\n\nSometimes the time required to run the codesigning step matters, so applesign allows to skip some steps and speedup the process.\n\nSee `--dont-verify` and `--parallel` commandline flags.\n\nEnabling those options can result on a 35% speedup on ~60MB IPAs.\n\nAPI usage\n---------\n\nHere's a simple program that resigns an IPA:\n\n```js\nconst Applesign = require('applesign');\n\nconst as = new Applesign({\n  identity: '81A24300FE2A8EAA99A9601FDA3EA811CD80526A',\n  mobileprovision: '/path/to/dev.mobileprovision',\n  withoutWatchapp: true\n});\nas.events.on('warning', (msg) => {\n  console.log('WARNING', msg);\n})\n.on('message', (msg) => {\n  console.log('msg', msg);\n});\n\nas.signIPA('/path/to/app.ipa')\n.then(_ => {\n  console.log('ios-deploy -b', as.config.outfile);\n})\n.catch(e => {\n  console.error(e);\n  process.exitCode = 1;\n});\n\n```\n\nTo list the developer identities available in the system:\n\n```js\ntry {\n  const ids = await as.getIdentities();\n  ids.forEach((id) => {\n    console.log(id.hash, id.name);\n  });\n} catch (err) {\n  console.error(err, ids);\n}\n```\n\nBear in mind that the Applesign object can tuned to use different\nconfiguration options:\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  file: '/path/to/app.ipa',\n  outfile: '/path/to/app-resigned.ipa',\n  entitlement: '/path/to/entitlement',\n  bundleid: 'app.company.bundleid',\n  identity: 'hash id of the developer',\n  mobileprovision: '/path/to/mobileprovision file',\n  ignoreVerificationErrors: true,\n  withoutWatchapp: true\n};\n```\n\nFurther reading\n---------------\n\nSee the Wiki: https://github.com/nowsecure/node-applesign/wiki\n\n* https://github.com/maciekish/iReSign\n* https://github.com/saucelabs/isign\n* https://github.com/phonegap/ios-deploy\n\nPre iOS9 devices will require a developer account:\n\n* http://dev.mlsdigital.net/posts/how-to-resign-an-ios-app-from-external-developers/\n"

It also creates the M3U8 stream\ndescriptor which is required for this type of stream.\n\nIt was originally written by Chase Douglas and is now maintained by John\nFerlito.\n\n##Installing\n\nTO install from source you will need to make sure you have the libav/ffmpeg\nlibraries installed. On Ubuntu/Debian you would run\n\n``` bash\napt-get install libavformat-dev\n```\n\nYou can then build and install m3u8-segmenter by running\n\n``` bash\naclocal\nautomake -ac\nautoconf\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n## Usage\n\nSome example command lines\n\n``` bash\nffmpeg -loglevel quiet  -i big_buck_bunny.ogv -f mpegts - | \\\n  m3u8-segmenter -i - -d 10 -p tmp/big_buck_bunny -m tmp/big_buck.m3u8 -u http://inodes.org/bigbuck/\n\nffmpeg -er 4 -i input.mp3 -f mpegts -acodec libmp3lame -ar 22050 -ab 32k -vn - | \\\n  m3u8-segmenter -i - -d 10 -p outputdir/prefix -m outputdir/output.m3u8 -u http://domain.com/\n```\n\n## Note on Patches/Pull Requests\n\n* Fork the project.\n* Make your feature addition or bug fix.\n* Add tests for it.

Image\n<img src=\"doc/widgets/image.png\" width=\"266px\" height=\"166px\" alt=\"Image\"/>\n\nCurrently the image must reside in the www folder of your app, or you must provide a base64 encoded image.\nIn the future we may add support for loading images from other locations (like the Internet).\n\n```js\n'image': {\n  // by not passing width and height the image is shown full size\n  'src': 'www/img/logo.png' // a file inside the www folder, if a 'data' attribute is passed as well, the src will not be used\n  'data': 'data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhDAAMALMBAP8AAP///wAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAUKAAEALAAAAAAMAAwAQAQZMMhJK7iY4p3nlZ8XgmNlnibXdVqolmhcRQA7' // base64 encoded png\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Label\n<img src=\"doc/widgets/label.png\" width=\"268px\" height=\"84px\" alt=\"Label\"/>\n\nThe label at the top is called `label`,\nyou can add a second one (with a different style perhaps) by adding a `label2`.\n\n```js\n'label': {\n  'value': 'A gorgeous blue header',\n  'color': '#1884C4',\n  'font': { // optional\n    'size': 10\n  }\n},\n'label2': { // optional, max 2 lines\n  'value': 'With a white message, served @ ' + new Date(),\n  'color': '#FFFFFF',\n  'font': {\n    'size': 8\n  }\n},\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Table\n<img src=\"doc/widgets/table.png\" width=\"269px\" height=\"252px\" alt=\"Table\"/>\n\nThis widget gives you more control over the layout,\nbecause a table may contain any number of rows, one or two columns,\nand a label, and image, or both inside each row.\n\n```js\nfunction onTableRowSelected(index) {\n  console.log('Selected table row index: ' + index);\n}\n\n'table': {\n  'callback':'onTableRowSelected',\n  'rows': [\n\n    // first row\n    {\n      'type': 'OneColumnRowType', // see the table below\n      // this element defines properties for the entire row\n      'group': {\n        'backgroundColor': '#1884C4',\n        'cornerRadius': 8\n      },\n      'label': {\n        'value':'  images!' // unlike in HTML, multiple spaces have effect\n      },\n      'imageLeft': {\n        'data': 'data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhDAAMALMBAP8AAP///wAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAUKAAEALAAAAAAMAAwAQAQZMMhJK7iY4p3nlZ8XgmNlnibXdVqolmhcRQA7',\n        'width': 25,\n        'height': 30\n      },\n      'imageRight': {\n        'src': 'www/img/logo.png',\n        'width': 25,\n        'height': 30\n      }\n    },\n\n    // second row\n    {\n      'type': 'OneColumnSelectableRowType',\n      'group': {\n        'backgroundColor': '#7884C4',\n        'cornerRadius': 8\n      },\n      'label': {\n        'value':'2nd row, no img'\n      }\n    },\n\n    // third row\n    {\n      'type': 'TwoColumnsRowType',\n      'col1label': {\n        'value': '50%',\n        'color': '#FFA500',\n        'font': {\n          'size': 16\n        }\n      },\n      'col2image': {\n        'src': 'www/img/logo.png',\n        'width': 25,\n        'height': 30\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe row's `type` attribute must be one of:\n\n|`type`|Description|\n|-----------|-----|\n|OneColumnRowType |A readonly row which can contain images and a label.|\n|TwoColumnsRowType |A readonly row with two evenly distributed columns. Each column can contain a centered label and/or image.|\n|OneColumnSelectableRowType |Same as `OneColumnRowType` but the entire row is 'clickable'. Once that's done, a `callback` specified on the table level will be invoked. Don't add this to a glance since those are readonly.|\n|Need something else?|This element is easily extensible, so please let us know what you want to see here..|\n\n\n#### Button\n<img src=\"doc/widgets/button.png\" width=\"266px\" height=\"250px\" alt=\"Button\"/>\n\nAll types of buttons can be styled with a bunch of properties.\nThose buttons above are rendered by this code:\n\n```js\n// the red one\n'userInputButton': {\n  'width': 60, // default full width, see the orange buttons\n  'height': 30,\n  'title': {\n    'value': 'Vote',\n    'color': '#FFFFFF',\n    'font': {\n      'size': 12\n    }\n  },\n  'backgroundColor': '#CC0000',\n  'alpha': 1 // which is the default\n},\n\n// the blue one\n'actionButton': {\n  'title': {\n    'value': 'Refresh',\n    'color': 'blaaaaaaa', // because this is rubbish, we fall back to the default (black)\n    'font': {\n      'size': 17\n    }\n  },\n  'color': '#FFFFFF',\n  'width':80,\n  'height':44\n},\n\n// the orange one\n'pushNavButton': {\n  'title': {\n    'value': 'Push nav'\n  },\n  'backgroundColor': '#FFA500'\n}\n```\n\n##### UserInputButton\n<img src=\"doc/widgets/userinput.png\" width=\"270px\" height=\"336px\" alt=\"User input\"/>\n\nThe `userInputButton` can be used to get input from the user (duh).\n\n```js\nfunction onUserInput(result) {\n  if (result.type == \"base64img\") {\n    console.log(\"An animated Emoji was selected\");\n    // you can show the image, for example add this: <img id=\"myImage\" src=\"\"/> and do this:\n    document.getElementById(\"myImage\").src = result.data;\n  } else {\n    // one of the pre-cooked anwers was picked, or a (non animated) Emoji, or even some fancy speech-to-text (dictation)\n    feedback(\"User input: \" + result.data);\n  }\n}\n\n// the same button as (the red one) shown before , but without the layout bits\n'userInputButton': {\n  'inputMode': 'WKTextInputModeAllowAnimatedEmoji', // see the table below for options\n  'suggestions': ['foo', 'bar', 'shaz'], // 0-3 possible suggestions\n  'title': {\n    'value': 'Vote',\n  },\n  'callback': 'onUserInput'\n}\n```\n\nThe `inputMode` attribute must be one of:\n\n|`inputMode`|Description|\n|-----------|-----|\n|WKTextInputModePlain | Dictation/suggested text only. The emoji button will be hidden. If you don't provide `suggestions` the dictation interface will be shown directly.|\n|WKTextInputModeAllowEmoji |Dictation, suggested text, and non-animated emoji.|\n|WKTextInputModeAllowAnimatedEmoji |Dictation, suggested text, and both animated and non-animated emoji.|\n\n\n##### ActionButton\n\nOf course you can do anything you like when a user pressed a button.\nLike fetching items from a remote server and navigating to a detail page on the watch.\n\n```js\nfunction onRefreshButtonPressed() {\n  console.log(\"Reloading the page\");\n  applewatch.loadApp(payload);\n}\n\n'actionButton': {\n  'title': {\n    'value': 'Refresh!',\n  },\n  'callback': 'onRefreshButtonPressed'\n}\n```\n\n##### Navigation button\n\nThere are two styles of navigation: 'push' and 'modal'.\nThe former performs a left-right slide animation and has a back button.\nThe latter stacks the new page on top of the other with a slide animation from the bottom and has a done/close button.\n\nThese buttons can only be used on the first app page and will navigate to the `AppDetail` page when activated.\n\n###### PushNavButton\n```js\n'pushNavButton': {\n  'backTitle': 'Go Back', // optional, only an arrow is shown if not provided\n  'title': {\n    'value': 'Push nav'\n  }\n}\n```\n\n###### ModalNavButton\n```js\n'modalNavButton': {\n  'closeTitle': 'Shut it', // optional, and it's recommended to use the default 'Cancel' because that's shown a short moment anyway\n  'title': {\n    'value': 'Modal nav'\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Loading a glance\nGlances are readonly pages which can be accessed by swiping up from the watchface.\nYour app can push content to the glance at any time and the watch will display the latest state it received.\nAlso, at the moment the glance is accessed by the user, the glance will request an update from your phone app\nby invoking the `applewatch.callback.onLoadGlanceRequest` method. If you don't provide an implementation the glance will remain black.\n\n<img src=\"doc/pages/glance.png\" width=\"268px\" height=\"324px\" alt=\"Glance\"/>\n\nIt's recommended that you do this on `deviceready` to configure the glance.\nTake a look at [our demo](demo/index.html) if you want a complete example.\n\nTo create the UI shown above, do:\n\n```js\nfunction onGlanceRequestsUpdate() {\n  var payload = {\n    'label': {\n      'value': 'A gorgeous blue header',\n      'color': '#1884C4',\n      'font': {\n        'size': 10\n      }\n    },\n    'label2': {\n      'value': 'With a white message, served @ ' + new Date(),\n      'color': '#FFFFFF',\n      'font': {\n        'size': 8\n      }\n    },\n    'image': {\n      'src': 'www/img/logo.png',\n      'alpha': 0.8\n    }\n  };\n  applewatch.loadGlance(payload);\n}\n\napplewatch.callback.onLoadGlanceRequest = onGlanceRequestsUpdate;\n```\n\nAnd here's a more concise way to configure a glance. In this case we'll only show an image.\n```js\napplewatch.callback.onLoadGlanceRequest = function() {\n  applewatch.loadGlance({\n    'image': {'src': 'www/img/logo.png'}\n  });\n}\n```\n\nGlances can't have buttons (they're readonly, remember), so tapping anywhere on the glance will launch your app.\n\nThe allowed widgets and its order are precooked in the storyboard.\nUnfortunately WatchKit doesn't allow dynamically created UI elements, but you can\nthrow a lot of items on a storyboard and show/hide them at will. That's what we're doing.\n\nA glance is divided in two sections and can't show more than one page (they don't scroll).\nThe supported widgets are (in *this* rendering order, and they're all optional):\n\n###### Top section\n|Variable name |Widget type|\n|-----------|-----|\n|label|Label|\n|label2|Label|\n\n###### Bottom section\n|Variable name |Widget type|\n|-----------|-----|\n|image|Image|\n|table|Table|\n|map|Map|\n\nTo be clear: this means you can't show a map above a table, but since the glance has very limited space\nyou probably only want one of those at a time anyway.\nThat being said if you need f.i. a label in the bottom section, let us know at the GitHub repository and we'll consider adding it.\n\n\n## Loading an app page\nThe basic idea is the same as the glance, but you have much more options.\n\nSo after `deviceready` has fired, you could do:\n```js\napplewatch.callback.onLoadAppMainRequest = function() {\nvar payload = {\n  'label': {\n    'value': 'Blue header label'\n  },\n  // you get the idea\n};\n\napplewatch.loadAppMain(payload);\n```\n\nAnd to load content into the app detail page:\n```js\napplewatch.callback.onLoadAppDetailRequest = function() {\n  var payload = {..};\n  applewatch.loadAppDetail(payload);\n}\n```\n\n### Page configuration\nThe pages have a little optional configuration to tweak your app even more:\n```js\nvar payload = {\n  'group': { // the page wrapper. The defaults are probably best though.\n    'backgroundColor':'#1884C4', // override the black background color\n    'cornerRadius': 0 // make your app square (the default has radius 4-ish)\n  },\n  'title': 'My app', // shown at the top of the page. Note that the title color can't be tweaked except in the storyboard itself\n  // .. any other stuff on your page\n};\n\n```\n\n###### App main page\n|Variable name |Widget type|\n|-----------|-----|\n|label|Label|\n|image|Image|\n|label2|Label|\n|table|Table|\n|switch|Switch|\n|switch2|Switch|\n|slider|Slider|\n|map|Map|\n|userInputButton|UserInputButton|\n|actionButton|ActionButton|\n|pushNavButton|PushNavButton|\n|modalNavButton|ModalNavButton|\n\nNote that since any unused variable is hidden we can easily add f.i. a 'label3'\nat the bottom of this stack, or add an 'actionButton2' below the other buttons.\nYou're welcome to request features like those and we'll try to add them\nwithout making too much of a mess and remaining compatibility with current usage.\n\n###### App detail page\nThe same as the main page, except for the last two items (the navigation buttons).\n\n## Navigating to an app page\nInstead of updating the content of the current page with `loadAppMain` or `loadAppDetail`,\nyou may want to programmatically navigate to a different page. You were already able to\nnavigate from main to detail on the watch itself by adding a `pushNavButton` or `modalNavButton`,\nbut the phone app can instantiate navigation as well.\n\n```js\n// navigate from main to detail:\napplewatch.navigateToAppDetail();\n\n// to navigate back from detail to main:\napplewatch.navigateToAppMain();\n```\n\nOne usecase could be to have a table with selectable rows, and in the table callback function\nyou'd navigate to the detail page. Once the detail page loads the `applewatch.callback.onLoadAppDetailRequest`\nfunction will fire so you can populate the detail page.\n\n## Notifications\nThe watch can receive remote and local notifications.\n These can have buttons which have a callback that invokes your phone app.\n To register for receiving those callbacks, configure these functions:\n\n\n```js\n// local notifications\napplewatch.callback.onLocalNotification = function(identifier) {..};\n\n// remote notifications\napplewatch.callback.onRemoteNotification = function(identifier) {..};\n\n```\n\nThe `identifier` is the identifier specified in any custom button in your notification payload.\n\nTODO elaborate and describe how to create a local notification.\n\n## Using your own storyboard\nIf you want more control over the layout, you can open the `Interface.storyboard` file in XCode,\nadjust it, and have the app load it by placing it here: `www/custom-watchkit-storyboards/Interface.storyboard`.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n#### Prep\nInstall npm 'xcode' package because our hooks need it: `npm install -g xcode`\n\n#### CLI\n```\n cordova create applewatchtest\n cd applewatchtest\n cordova platform add ios\n```\n\n#### XCode\nFile > New > Target > Apple Watch: Language ObjC, Select Glance and Notifications > Finish > Activate\n\n#### CLI\n```\n cordova plugin add https://github.com/Telerik-Verified-Plugins/AppleWatch\n cordova prepare\n```\n\n#### XCode\nSet CFBundleVersion (Bundle Version) and CFBundleShortVersionString (Bundle versions string, short) of all targets to the same value (use XCode's search feature and change all 3 .plist values)\n\n\nAt this point your builds should succeed\n\n\n#### More XCode\nApp Groups: register an appgroup in your iOS member center (Identifiers > App Groups): we expect group.<packagename>, like group.io.cordova.hellocordova, then add it to your App ID.\nNow generate a provisioning profile with the new App ID and add it XCode (download, then double-click the file should do it).\nIn XCode, go to your targets and add this app group to both the phone and watch app targets (Capabilities tab).\n\n\n## Tips:\nBuilding in XCode 7 requires you to set `bitcode` to `NO` for all 3 targets. Go to 'Build Settings' and disable it 3 times. Will be fixed soon, when [MMWormhole](https://github.com/mutualmobile/MMWormhole) is updated.\n\nFor developer builds to work on a real Watch you'll need to [register the Watch UDID and add it to the provisioning profile](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29854314/debug-on-real-apple-watch-application-verification-failed) or you'll see 'Application verification failed' when installing the app on the Watch.\n\nWhile you're in the iOS member center, also register an App Group (under Identifiers) and make sure you enable the App Group in the App ID you're using for your app.\n\nIf you want a quickstart, use `demo/index.html`\n\nThe simulator doesn't support local notifications\n\nDebugging of both the app and the extension: http://www.fiveminutewatchkit.com/blog/2015/3/13/how-to-debug-an-ios-app-while-the-associated-watchkit-app-is-running\n\nNotifications: http://natashatherobot.com/watchkit-actionable-notifications/\n\n\n## Kudos \n[Lee Crossley](https://github.com/leecrossley/cordova-plugin-apple-watch) for his work on figuring out how to add and use the wormhole lib in a Cordova plugin\n"

You'll need Xcode 13.1 (or later) which you can download from the [App Store](https://developer.apple.com/download/). You can get the app running using the following commands:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/home-assistant/iOS.git\ncd iOS\n\n# you must do one of the following, but you do not need to do all of them:\n\n## install cocoapods via homebrew, use that\nbrew install cocoapods\npod install --repo-update\n\n## install ruby via homebrew, use that\nbrew install ruby@2.7\n/usr/local/opt/ruby@2.7/bin/bundle install\n/usr/local/opt/ruby@2.7/bin/bundle exec pod install --repo-update\n\n## install ruby via rbenv, use that\nbrew install rbenv ruby-build\nrbenv install\nbundle install\nbundle exec pod install --repo-update\n```\n\nOnce this completes, you can launch  `HomeAssistant.xcworkspace` and run the `App-Debug` scheme onto your simulator or iOS device.\n\n## Testing just the frontend\n\nTo just test the [frontend](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend), you can use a simulator version built by our GitHub actions.\n\n1. Install Xcode from the [App Store](https://developer.apple.com/download/) making sure it's at least the version noted above. You do not need to install or run anything else.\n2. Launch the simulator at `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/Simulator.app` or in Xcode under the Xcode menu > Open Developer Tool.\n3. Open a simulator under File > Open Simulator. You can install older versions of iOS in Xcode's Components preferences.\n4. Download a simulator build from the [the GitHub action](https://github.com/home-assistant/iOS/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amaster) under \"Artifacts.\"\n5. Drag the result `.app` on drop it on top of the simulator.\n6. Locate the app on the home screen and click it to launch.\n\nThe simulator behaves different than you might expect:\n\n| Action | Effect |\n| -- | -- |\n| Click | Tap |\n| Click & drag | Scroll |\n| Hold \u2325 | Add a second touch point |\n| Hold \u21e7\u2325 | Move both touch points |\n| \u2318\u2190, \u2318\u2192 | Rotate |\n| \u2318S | Take screenshot |\n| \u2318R | Record video |\n| \u2318K | Toggle software keyboard |\n\nYou can now debug the WebView in this simulator build using Safari's Web Inspector:\n\n1. Make sure \"Show Develop menu in menu bar\" is enabled in Safari's Advanced preferences.\n2. Under the Develop menu, expand the \"Simulator\" menu for the simulator you've opened.\n3. Choose the WebView you want to inspect. A new window will open.\n\n## Code Signing\n\nAlthough the app is set up to use Automatic provisioning for Debug builds, you'll need to customize a few of the options. This is because the app makes heavy use of entitlements that require code signing, even for simulator builds.\n\nEdit the file `Configuration/HomeAssistant.overrides.xcconfig` (which will not exist by default and is ignored by git) and add the following:\n\n```bash\nDEVELOPMENT_TEAM = YourTeamID\nBUNDLE_ID_PREFIX = some.bundle.prefix\n```\n\nXcode should generate provisioning profiles in your Team ID and our configuration will disable features your team doesn't have like Critical Alerts. You can find your Team ID on Apple's [developer portal](https://developer.apple.com/account); it looks something like `ABCDEFG123`.\n\n## Code style\n\nLinters run as part of Pull Request checks. Additionally, some linting requirements can be autocorrected.\n\n```bash\n# checks for linting problems, doesn't fix\nbundle exec fastlane lint\n# checks for linting problems and fixes them\nbundle exec fastlane autocorrect\n```\n\nIn the Xcode project, the autocorrectable linters will not modify your source code but will provide warnings. This project uses several linters:\n\n- [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat)\n- [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/swiftlint) (for things SwiftFormat doesn't automate)\n- [Rubocop](https://rubocop.org) (largely for Fastlane)\n- [YamlLint](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) (largely for GitHub Actions)\n\n## Continuous Integration\n\nWe use [Github Actions](https://github.com/home-assistant/iOS/actions) alongside [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) to perform continuous integration both by unit testing and deploying to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com). Mac Developer ID builds are available as an artifact on every build of master.\n\n### Environment variables\n\nFastlane scripts read from the environment or `.env` file for configuration like team IDs. See [`.env.sample`](https://github.com/home-assistant/iOS/blob/master/.env.sample) for available values.\n\n### Deployment\n\nAlthough all the deployment is done through Github Actions, you can do it manually through [Fastlane](https://github.com/home-assistant/iOS/blob/master/fastlane/README.md):\n\n### Deployment to App Store Connect\n\n```bash\n# creates the builds and uploads to the app store\n# each save their artifacts to build/\nbundle exec fastlane mac build\nbundle exec fastlane ios build\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## LICENSE\n\nApache-2.0\n\n## Credits\n\nThe format and some content of this README.md comes from the [SwipeIt](https://github.com/ivanbruel/SwipeIt) project.\n"

  "readme_contents": "#One Page Scroll 1.3.1 by Pete R.\nCreate an Apple-like one page scroll website (iPhone 5S website) with One Page Scroll plugin\nCreated by [Pete R.](http://www.thepetedesign.com), Founder of [BucketListly](http://www.bucketlistly.com)\n\nLicense: [Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en_US)\n\n\n## Requirement\n\njQuery (1.9.0 or later)\n\nnote: jQuery 1.9.0 or later is strongly recommended because using jQuery less than 1.8.3 and jquery.onepage-scroll.js together turns out to be a hash-based XSS vulnerabiliry.\n\nsee: http://jsfiddle.net/33WJx/\n\n## Demo\n[View demo](http://peachananr.github.io/onepage-scroll/Demo/demo.html)\n\n## Compatibility\nModern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on both desktop and smartphones have been tested. Should work fine on IE8 and IE9 as well.\n\n## Basic Usage\nOne Page Scroll let you transform your website into a one page scroll website that allows users to scroll one page at a time. It is perfect for creating a website in which you want to present something to the viewers. For example, [Apple's iPhone 5S website](http://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/) uses the same technique.\n\n\nTo add this to your website, simply include the latest jQuery library together with `jquery.onepage-scroll.js`, `onepage-scroll.css` into your document's `<head>` and call the function as follows:\n\n````html\n<body>\n  ...\n  <div class=\"main\">\n    <section>...</section>\n    <section>...</section>\n    ...\n  </div>\n  ...\n</body>\n````\nContainer \"Main\" must be one level below the `body` tag in order to make it work full page. Now call the function to activate as follows:\n\n````javascript\n$(\".main\").onepage_scroll({\n   sectionContainer: \"section\",     // sectionContainer accepts any kind of selector in case you don't want to use section\n   easing: \"ease\",                  // Easing options accepts the CSS3 easing animation such \"ease\", \"linear\", \"ease-in\",\n                                    // \"ease-out\", \"ease-in-out\", or even cubic bezier value such as \"cubic-bezier(0.175, 0.885, 0.420, 1.310)\"\n   animationTime: 1000,             // AnimationTime let you define how long each section takes to animate\n   pagination: true,                // You can either show or hide the pagination. Toggle true for show, false for hide.\n   updateURL: false,                // Toggle this true if you want the URL to be updated automatically when the user scroll to each page.\n   beforeMove: function(index) {},  // This option accepts a callback function. The function will be called before the page moves.\n   afterMove: function(index) {},   // This option accepts a callback function. The function will be called after the page moves.\n   loop: false,                     // You can have the page loop back to the top/bottom when the user navigates at up/down on the first/last page.\n   keyboard: true,                  // You can activate the keyboard controls\n   responsiveFallback: false,        // You can fallback to normal page scroll by defining the width of the browser in which\n                                    // you want the responsive fallback to be triggered. For example, set this to 600 and whenever\n                                    // the browser's width is less than 600, the fallback will kick in.\n   direction: \"vertical\"            // You can now define the direction of the One Page Scroll animation. Options available are \"vertical\" and \"horizontal\". The default value is \"vertical\".  \n});\n````\nAnd that's it. Now, your website should work the same way Apple's iPhone 5S website does. You should be able to swipe up/down as well (thanks to [Eike Send](https://github.com/eikes) for his swipe events!) when viewing your website on mobile phones.\n\n## Keyboard Shortcuts\nYou can trigger page move with hotkeys as well:\n\n### Up arrow / Page Up\nPressing the up arrow or the page up key allows you to move the page up by one.\n\n\n### Down arrow / Page Donw\nPressing the down arrow or the page down key allows you to move the page down by one.\n\n### Spacebar\nPressing the space key allows you to move the page down by one.\n\n### Home\nPressing the home key brings you back to the first page.\n\n\n### End\nPressing the end key brings you to the last page.\n\n## Public Methods\nYou can also trigger page move programmatically as well:\n\n### $.fn.moveUp()\nThis method allows you to move the page up by one. This action is equivalent to scrolling up/swiping down.\n\n````javascript\n  $(\".main\").moveUp();\n````\n\n### $.fn.moveDown()\nThis method allows you to move the page down by one. This action is equivalent to scrolling down/swiping up.\n\n````javascript\n  $(\".main\").moveDown();\n````\n\n### $.fn.moveTo(page_index)\nThis method allows you to move to the specified page index programatically.\n\n````javascript\n  $(\".main\").moveTo(3);\n````\n\n## Callbacks\nYou can use callbacks to perform actions before or after the page move.\n\n### beforeMove(current_page_index)\nThis callback gets called before the plugin performs its move.\n\n````javascript\n  $(\".main\").onepage_scroll({\n    beforeMove: function(index) {\n      ...\n    }\n  });\n````\n\n### afterMove(next_page_index)\nThis callback gets called after the move animation was performed.\n\n````javascript\n  $(\".main\").onepage_scroll({\n    afterMove: function(index) {\n      ...\n    }\n  });\n````\n\nIf you want to see more of my plugins, visit [The Pete Design](http://www.thepetedesign.com/#design), or follow me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/peachananr) and [Github](http://www.github.com/peachananr).\n\n## Other Resources\n- [OnePageScroll.js: Creating an Apple\u2019s iPhone 5S Website](http://www.onextrapixel.com/2013/09/18/onepagescroll-js-creating-an-apples-iphone-5s-website/)\n- [Eike Send's jQuery Swipe Events](https://github.com/eikes/jquery.swipe-events.js)\n- [CSS Easing generator by Matthew Lein](http://matthewlein.com/ceaser/)\n"

Here's what they had to say:\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en-gb\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/benjaminmumford\">@benjaminmumford</a> Hi Ben, there are no plans currently, but you should still be able to use Airplay <a href=\"http://t.co/qnaUSZIPis\">http://t.co/qnaUSZIPis</a></p>&mdash; BBC iPlayer (@BBCiPlayer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCiPlayer/status/642758870952222720\">September 12, 2015</a></blockquote> \n\nThis was a disappointing response \u2014 not just because we want to watch world class BBC programming on our Apple TV \u2014 but because they have a public responsibility to do so:\n\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>Make engaging digital content and services available on a wide range of digital platforms and devices.</p>\n\t<p>&mdash;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/whoweare/publicpurposes/communication.html\">BBC Public Purpose</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe app we're publishing here was built in just under *9 hours* at a hack event to prove it could be done. It's by no means complete or perfect, and it's very much a proof of concept. It's our hope the BBC will release an official app for Apple TV, as they've made iPlayer available on a wide range of other set-top boxes and Smart TVs. \n\n## Will you submit this to the App Store?\n\nNo. This project is merely a proof of concept to see what can be achieved with the tvOS platform and the BBC's amazing content. \n\n## How did you work out how the BBC API works?\n\nWe used a mixture of snooping network requests from the iOS client and searching around for resources online. We found a [great article from an engineer who worked on the API](http://smethur.st/posts/176135860) which helped us understand some of the concepts powering it. \n\n## Why Auntie Player?\n\n[Because Auntie knows best.](http://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-23572,00.html)"

  "readme_contents": "Siri Proxy\n==========\n\nSiriProxy and iOS 7\n-------------------\n\n***SiriProxy does not (at this time) work with iOS 7***. Significant changes made to the Siri protocol stack have rendered SiriProxy inoperable with iOS 7. Some of the changes are easy to patch, others may wind up requiring significant work. See [#542](https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy/issues/542) for ongoing discussion regarding the effort to make SiriProxy work with iOS 7. However, SiriProxy may *never* support iOS 7. So if SiriProxy is important, you should avoid upgrading your device.\n\n\nAbout\n-----\nSiri Proxy is a proxy server for Apple's Siri \"assistant.\" The idea is to allow for the creation of custom handlers for different actions. This can allow developers to easily add functionality to Siri. \n\nThe main example I provide is a plugin to control [my thermostat](http://www.radiothermostat.com/latestnews.html#advanced) with Siri. It responds to commands such as, \"What's the status of the thermostat?\", or \"Set the thermostat to 68 degrees\", or even \"What's the inside temperature?\"\n\nNotice About Plugins\n--------------------\n\nWe recently changed the way plugins work very significantly. That being the case, your old plugins won't work. \n\nNew plugins should be independent Gems. Take a look at the included [example plugin](https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy/tree/master/plugins/siriproxy-example) for some inspiration. We will try to keep that file up to date with the latest features. \n\nThe State of This Project\n------------------------- \n\nPlease remember that this project is super-pre-alpha right now. If you're not a developer with a good bit of experience with networks, you're probably not even going to get the proxy running. But if you do (we are willing to help to an extent, check the IRC chat and my Twitter feed [@plamoni](http://www.twitter.com/plamoni)), then test out building a plugin. It's very easy to do and takes almost no time at all for most experienced developers. Check the demo videos and other plugins below for inspiration!\n\n\nFind us on IRC\n--------------\n\nWe now have an IRC channel. Check out the #SiriProxy channel on irc.freenode.net.\n\nDemo Video\n-----------\n\nSee the system in action here: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN6wy0keQqo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN6wy0keQqo)\n\nMore Demo Videos and Other Plugins\n----------------------------------\n\nFor a list of current plugins and some more demo videos, check the [Plugins page](https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy/wiki/Plugins) on the wiki.  \n\nSet-up Instructions\n-------------------\n\n**NEW Instructions for 0.5.0**\n\nNote that the installation instructions have changed. It's no longer necessary to install dnsmasq. Also, SiriProxy is available via rubygems for easy installation.\n\n**Set up RVM and Ruby 2.0.0**\n\nIf you don't already have Ruby 2.0.0 (or at least 1.9.3) installed through RVM, please do so in order to make sure you can follow the steps later. Experts can ignore this. If you're unsure, follow these directions carefully:\n\n1. Install pre-requisites. Veries by system. For a fresh Ubuntu 12.10 install, these seem to be good:\n\n\t`sudo apt-get install libxslt1.1 libxslt-dev xvfb build-essential git-core curl libyaml-dev libssl-dev`\n\n2. Download and install RVM (if you don't have it already):\n\t* Download/install RVM:  \n\t\t`curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby`  \n\t* Update .bashrc:  \n\t\t`echo '[[ -s \"$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm\" ]] && source \"$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm\"' >> ~/.bashrc`\n\t\t`echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.rvm/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc`  \n\t* Activate changes:  \n\t\t`. ~/.bashrc`   \n\n3. Install Ruby 2.0.0 (if you don't have it already):   \n\n\t`rvm install 2.0.0`  \n\n4. Set RVM to use/default to 2.0.0:   \n\n\t`rvm use 2.0.0 --default`\n\t\n**Set up SiriProxy**\n\n1. Install SiriProxy Gem\n \n\t`gem install siriproxy`\n\n2. Create `~/.siriproxy` directory\n\n\t`mkdir ~/.siriproxy`\n\n3. Generate Certificates\n\n\t`siriproxy gencerts`\n\n4. Transfer certificate to your phone (it will be located at `~/.siriproxy/ca.pem`, email it to your phone)\n5. Start SiriProxy (`XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX` should be replaced with your server's IP address, e.g. `192.168.1.100`), `nobody` can be replaced with any un-privileged user.\n\n\t`rvmsudo siriproxy server -d XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX -u nobody`\n\n6. Tell your phone to use your SiriProxy server as its DNS server (under your Wifi settings)\n7. Test that the server is running by saying \"Test Siri Proxy\" to your phone.\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n**Will this let me run Siri on my none Siri devices (eg. iPhone 4, iPod Touch, iPhone 3G, Microwave, etc)?**\n\nNo. Please stop asking. \n\n**What is your opinion on h1siri, public SiriProxy servers, and other Siri \"ports\"?**\n\nGlad you asked! Watch this: [http://youtu.be/Y_Q6PfxBSbA](http://youtu.be/Y_Q6PfxBSbA)\n\n**How do I generate the certificate?**\n\nCertificates can now be easily generated using `siriproxy gencerts` once you install the SiriProxy gem. See the instructions above.\n\n**How do I set up a DNS server to forward Guzzoni.apple.com traffic to my computer?**\n\nCheck out my video on this: \n\n[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9gO4L0U59s](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9gO4L0U59s)\n\n**Will this work outside my home network?**\n\nNo, it won't. But, as suggested by STBullard on YouTube, you COULD VPN into your home network from outside your house in order to make this work. That would not require a jailbreak. Of course, it also means ALL your traffic gets funneled through your home network. The nice thing about adding an entry to your /etc/hosts file (on a jailbroken phone) is that it funnels only Siri traffic through your home network, and not all your traffic.\n\n**Can you provide me with an iPhone 4S UDID?**\n\nNo. Don't even ask.\n\n**I'm getting a bunch of \"[Info - Guzzoni] Object: SessionValidationFailed\" messages. What's wrong?!**\n\nYou're probably using a device without an official Siri. You need to be using an official Siri device (or have a UDID you can sub in) in order to make use of SiriProxy. Sorry, this is not designed to be a way around that limitation. (Thanks to [@brownie545](http://www.twitter.com/brownie545) for providing information on what happens when you use a unofficial Siri-devices)\n\n**How do I remove the certificate from my iPhone when I'm done?**\n\nJust go into your phone's Settings app, then go to \"General->Profiles.\" Your CA will probably be the only thing listed under \"Configuration Profiles.\" It will be listed as \"SiriProxyCA\" Just click it and click \"Remove\" and it will be removed. (Thanks to [@tidegu](http://www.twitter.com/tidegu) for asking!)\n\n**Does this require a jailbreak?**\n\nNo. The only action you need to take on the phone is to install the root CA's public key.\n\n**Using Siri causes a whole bunch of the following messages, followed by SiriProxy crashing!**\n\n\tCreate server for iPhone connection\n\tstart conn #<SiriProxy::Connection::Iphone:0x966a400 @signature=880, @processed_headers=false, @output_buffer=\"\", @input_buffer=\"\", @unzipped_input=\"\", @unzipped_output=\"\", @unzip_stream=#<Zlib::Inflate:0x9669640>, @zip_stream=#<Zlib::Deflate:0x96695dc>, @consumed_ace=false, @name=\"iPhone\", @ssled=false>\n\t[Info - Plugin Manager] Plugins loaded: [#<SiriProxy::Plugin::Example:0x968a818 @manager=#<SiriProxy::PluginManager:0x9685750 @plugins=[...]>>]\n\t\nThis is actually really common (but can be tricky to fix). The problem is that your SiriProxy server is using your tainted DNS server. So what happens is this:\n\n1. Your iPhone connects to your server, thinking it's `guzzoni.apple.com`\n2. Your server connects to *itself*, thinking that *it's* `guzzoni.apple.com`\n3. Your server thinks another iPhone has connected, and repeats step 2.\n\nThis goes on forever, or at least a second or two before the server up and dies. The trick is that you need to make sure your server isn't connecting to itself when it requests a connection to `guzzoni.apple.com`. This is actually the default behavior, but many people accidentally mess things up by either (1) setting up their server to use itself as a DNS server (while using dnsmasq to taint the entry for `guzzoni.apple.com`), or (2) putting their server on a network where the DNS server issued by DHCP is tainted to point to the wrong `guzzoni.apple.com`.\n\nSo the fix for this varies based on your setup, but one possible fix for scenario 1 (above) on many *NIX machines is to edit `/etc/resolve.conf` and change the `nameserver` entry to `8.8.8.8` (one of Google's public DNS servers). Do this and then restart networking (or just restart the computer) and things should start working.\n\nYour network setup may be different. This is THE most complex part of setting up SiriProxy (getting DNS set up correctly). So once you have this working, you are probably home free. Keep with it, good luck, and have fun!\n\n\nRunning SiriProxy as an unprivileged user\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThis used to be really hard. Now it's very easy. Just run `rvmsudo siriproxy server -u USER` and SiriProxy will set it's userid to `USER`'s userid.\n\nRunning SiriProxy via Upstart\n-----------------------------\n\n**NOTE: This section needs to be updated.** It was written before some of the newer features for SiriProxy. It should be much simpler now.\n\nHere's the upstart script I created for my home SiriProxy server. It respawns on a crash because SiriProxy is delicate and likes to crash. My server is running BackTrack 5 (a derivative of Ubuntu 10.04, I believe) and I use it as my wireless access point, making it an obvious location for SiriProxy:\n\n\tdescription\t\"SiriProxy server\"\n\t\n\t#Not sure if this is right, but it seems to work.\n\tstart on (started networking\n\t\t\t  and filesystem)\n\t\n\tstop on runlevel [!023456]\n\t\n\trespawn\n\t\n\texec start-stop-daemon --start --exec /home/siriproxy/src/SiriProxy/siriproxy2000.sh\n\nHere are the contents of `siriproxy2000.sh` (as referenced above):\n\n\t#!/bin/bash\n\t\n\t#make sure that rvm is set up\n\t[[ -s \"/home/siriproxy/.rvm/scripts/rvm\" ]] && . \"/home/siriproxy/.rvm/scripts/rvm\"\n\t\n\t#feel free to insert logging if needed.\n\tsiriproxy server --port 2000 > /dev/null 2>&1 \n\t\nNote that I run my server on port 2000 as the siriproxy user. See the comments above about running as an unprivileged user.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\nI really can't give enough credit to [Applidium](http://applidium.com/en/news/cracking_siri/) and the [tools they created](https://github.com/applidium/Cracking-Siri). While I've been toying with Siri for a while, their proof of concept for intercepting and interpreting the Siri protocol was invaluable. Although all the code included in the project (so far) is my own, much of the base logic behind my code is based on the sample code they provided. They do great work.\n\nI also want to give a shout-out to [Arch Reactor](http://www.archreactor.org) - my local Hackerspace. Hackerspaces are a fantastic place to go learn about stuff like this. I was able to get some help from folks there, and more importantly, I got encouragement to do stuff like this. Check [Hackerspaces.org](http://www.hackerspaces.org) for a hackerspace in your area and make sure to check it out! \n\nRegarding Licensing\n-------------------\n\nIt's a pain. MIT seems nice. Go hunt through the commit history if you're interested in knowing about SiriProxy's long and frustrating licensing history.\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\n\nSiriProxy - A tampering proxy server for the Siri (Ace) Protocol.\nCopyright (c) 2013 Pete Lamonica\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

  "readme_contents": "# OpenDrop: an Open Source AirDrop Implementation\n\n[![Release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/opendrop?color=%23EC6500&label=release)](https://pypi.org/project/opendrop/)\n[![Language grade](https://img.shields.io/lgtm/grade/python/github/seemoo-lab/opendrop?label=code%20quality)](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/seemoo-lab/opendrop/context:python)\n\n*OpenDrop* is a command-line tool that allows sharing files between devices directly over Wi-Fi. Its unique feature is that it is protocol-compatible with Apple AirDrop which allows to share files with Apple devices running iOS and macOS. \n~~Currently (and probably also for the foreseeable future), OpenDrop only supports sending to Apple devices that are discoverable by *everybody* as the default *contacts only* mode requires [Apple-signed certificates](https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/pdf/Apple_AAI_CPS_v6.1.pdf).~~\nWe support contacts-only devices by using extracted AirDrop credentials (keys and certificates) from macOS via our [keychain extractor](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/airdrop-keychain-extractor).\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nOpenDrop is experimental software and is the result of reverse engineering efforts by the [Open Wireless Link](https://owlink.org) project.\nTherefore, it does not support all features of AirDrop or might be incompatible with future AirDrop versions.\nOpenDrop is not affiliated with or endorsed by Apple Inc. Use this code at your own risk.\n\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo achieve compatibility with Apple AirDrop, OpenDrop requires the target platform to support a specific Wi-Fi link layer.\nIn addition, it requires Python >=3.6 as well as several libraries.\n\n**Apple Wireless Direct Link.**\nAs AirDrop exclusively runs over Apple Wireless Direct Link (AWDL), OpenDrop is only supported on macOS or on Linux systems running an open re-implementation of AWDL such as [OWL](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/owl).\n\n**Libraries.**\nOpenDrop relies on a current version of [libarchive](https://www.libarchive.org).\nmacOS ships with a rather old version, so you will need to install a newer version, for example, via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):\n```bash\nbrew install libarchive\n```\nOpenDrop automatically sets `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` to look for the Homebrew version. You may need to update the variable yourself if you install the libraries differently.\n\nLinux distributions should ship with more up-to-date versions, so this won't be necessary.\n\n\n## Installation \n\nInstallation of the Python package [release](https://pypi.org/project/opendrop/) is straightforward using `pip3`:\n```\npip3 install opendrop\n```\n\nYou can also install the current development version by first cloning this repository, and then installing it via `pip3`:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/seemoo-lab/opendrop.git\npip3 install ./opendrop\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\nWe briefly explain how to send and receive files using `opendrop`.\nTo see all command line options, run `opendrop -h`.\n\n### Sending a File or a Link\n\nSending a file is typically a two-step procedure. You first discover devices in proximity using the `find` command.\nStop the process once you have found the receiver.\n```\n$ opendrop find\nLooking for receivers.

Simply use the `receive` command. OpenDrop will accept all incoming files automatically and put received files in the current directory.\n```\n$ opendrop receive\n```\n\n\n## Current Limitations/TODOs\n\nOpenDrop is the result of a research project and, thus, has several limitations (non-exhaustive list below). I do not have the capacity to work on them myself but am happy to provide assistance if somebody else want to take them on.\n\n* *Triggering macOS/iOS receivers via Bluetooth Low Energy.* Apple devices start their AWDL interface and AirDrop server only after receiving a custom advertisement via Bluetooth LE (see USENIX paper for details). This means, that Apple AirDrop receivers may not be discovered even if they are discoverable by *everyone*.\n\n* *Sender/Receiver authentication and connection state.* Currently, there is no peer authentication as in Apple's AirDrop, in particular, (1) OpenDrop does not verify that the TLS certificate is signed by [Apple's root](opendrop/certs/apple_root_ca.pem) and (2) that the Apple ID validation record is correct (see USENIX paper for details). In addition, OpenDrop automatically accepts any file that it receives due to a missing connection state.\n\n* *Sending multiple files.* Apple AirDrop supports sending multiple files at once, OpenDrop does not (would require adding more files to the archive, modify HTTP /Ask request, etc.).\n\n\n## Our Papers\n\n* Alexander Heinrich, Matthias Hollick, Thomas Schneider, Milan Stute, and Christian Weinert. **PrivateDrop: Practical Privacy-Preserving Authentication for Apple AirDrop.** *30th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security \u201921)*, August 14\u201316, 2019, virtual Event.

The apps (for both iOS and Android) use Bluetooth technology to exchange anonymous encrypted data with other mobile phones (on which the app is also installed) in the vicinity of an app user's phone. The data is stored locally on each user's device, preventing authorities or other parties from accessing or controlling the data. This repository contains the **implementation of the server for encryption keys** for the Corona-Warn-App.\n\nIn this documentation, Corona-Warn-App services are also referred to as CWA services.\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nYou can find the architecture overview [here](/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), which will give you\na good starting point in how the backend services interact with other services, and what purpose\nthey serve.\n\n## Development\n\nAfter you've checked out this repository, you can run the application in one of the following ways:\n\n* As a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)-based deployment on your local machine. You can run either:\n  * Single components using the respective Dockerfile or\n  * The full backend using the Docker Compose (which is considered the most convenient way)\n* As a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)-based build on your local machine.\n  If you want to develop something in a single component, this approach is preferable.\n\n### Docker-Based Deployment\n\nIf you want to use Docker-based deployment, you need to install Docker on your local machine. For more information about downloading and installing Docker, see the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).\n\n#### Running the Full CWA Backend Using Docker Compose\n\nFor your convenience, a full setup for local development and testing purposes, including the generation of test data has been prepared using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/). To build the backend services, run ```docker-compose build``` in the repository's root directory. A default configuration file can be found under ```.env``` in the root folder of the repository. If the endpoints are to be exposed to the network the default values in this file should be changed before docker-compose is run.\n\nOnce the services are built, you can start the whole backend using ```docker-compose up```.\nThe distribution service runs once and then finishes. If you want to trigger additional distribution runs, run ```docker-compose run distribution```.\n\nThe docker-compose contains the following services:\n\nService           | Description | Endpoint and Default Credentials\n------------------|-------------|-----------\nsubmission        | The Corona-Warn-App submission service                                                      | `http://localhost:8000` <br> `http://localhost:8006` (for actuator endpoint)\ndistribution      | The Corona-Warn-App distribution service                                                    | NO ENDPOINT\npostgres          | A [postgres] database installation                                                          | `localhost:8001` <br> `postgres:5432` (from containerized pgadmin) <br> Username: postgres <br> Password: postgres\npgadmin           | A [pgadmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) installation for the postgres database                | `http://localhost:8002` <br> Username: user@domain.com <br> Password: password\ncloudserver       | [Zenko CloudServer] is a S3-compliant object store  | `http://localhost:8003/` <br> Access key: accessKey1 <br> Secret key: verySecretKey1\nverification-fake | A very simple fake implementation for the tan verification.                                 | `http://localhost:8004/version/v1/tan/verify` <br> The only valid tan is `edc07f08-a1aa-11ea-bb37-0242ac130002`.\n\n##### Known Limitation\n\nIn rare cases the docker-compose runs into a timing issue if the distribution service starts before the bucket of the objectstore was created. This is not a big issue as you can simply run ```docker-compose run distribution``` to trigger additional distribution runs after the objectstore was initialized.\n\n#### Running Single CWA Services Using Docker\n\nIf you would like to build and run a single CWA service, it's considered easiest to run them in a Docker environment. You can do this using the script provided in the respective CWA service directory. The Docker script first builds the CWA service and then creates an image for the runtime, which means that there are no additional dependencies for you to install.\n\nTo build and run the distribution service, run the following command:\n\n```bash\n./services/distribution/build_and_run.sh\n```\n\nTo build and run the submission service, run the following command:\n\n```bash\n./services/submission/build_and_run.sh\n```\n\nThe submission service is available on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080 ).\n\n### Maven-Based Build\n\nIf you want to actively develop in one of the CWA services, the Maven-based runtime is most suitable.\nTo prepare your machine to run the CWA project locally, we recommend that you first ensure that you've installed the following:\n\n* Minimum JDK Version 11: [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/) / [SapMachine](https://sap.github.io/SapMachine/)\n* [Maven 3.6](https://maven.apache.org/)\n* [Postgres]\n* [Zenko CloudServer]\n\nIf you are already running a local Postgres, you need to create a database `cwa` and run the following setup scripts:\n\n* Create the different CWA roles first by executing [create-roles.sql](./setup/setup-roles.sql).\n* Create local database users for the specific roles by running [create-users.sql](./local-setup/create-users.sql).\n* It is recommended to also run [enable-test-data-docker-compose.sql](./local-setup/enable-test-data-docker-compose.sql)\n, which enables the test data generation profile. If you already had CWA running before and an existing `diagnosis-key`\ntable on your database, you need to run [enable-test-data.sql](./local-setup/enable-test-data.sql) instead.\n\nYou can also use `docker-compose` to start Postgres and Zenko. If you do that, you have to\nset the following environment-variables when running the Spring project:\n\nFor the distribution module:\n\n```bash\nPOSTGRESQL_SERVICE_PORT=8001\nVAULT_FILESIGNING_SECRET=</path/to/your/private_key>\nSPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=signature-dev,disable-ssl-client-postgres\n```\n\nFor the submission module:\n\n```bash\nPOSTGRESQL_SERVICE_PORT=8001\nSPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=disable-ssl-client-postgres\n```\n\n#### Configure\n\nAfter you made sure that the specified dependencies are running, configure them in the respective configuration files.\n\n* Configure the Postgres connection in the [submission config](./services/submission/src/main/resources/application.yaml) and in the [distribution config](./services/distribution/src/main/resources/application.yaml)\n* Configure the S3 compatible object storage in the [distribution config](./services/distribution/src/main/resources/application.yaml)\n* Configure the private key for the distribution service, the path need to be prefixed with `file:`\n  * `VAULT_FILESIGNING_SECRET` should be the path to the private key, example available in `<repo-root>/docker-compose-test-secrets/private.pem`\n\n#### Build\n\nAfter you've checked out the repository, to build the project, run ```mvn install``` in your base directory.\n\n#### Run\n\nNavigate to the service you want to start and run the spring-boot:run target. The configured Postgres and the configured S3 compliant object storage are used as default. When you start the submission service, the endpoint is available on your local port 8080.\n\nIf you want to start the submission service, for example, you start it as follows:\n\n```bash\n  cd services/submission/\n  mvn spring-boot:run\n```\n\n#### Debugging\n\nTo enable the `DEBUG` log level, you can run the application using the Spring `debug` profile.\n\n```bash\nmvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=debug\n```\n\nTo be able to set breakpoints (e.g. in IntelliJ), it may be necessary to use the ```-Dspring-boot.run.fork=false``` parameter.\n\n## Service APIs\n\nThe API that is being exposed by the backend services is documented in an [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification. The specification files are available at the following locations:\n\nService                   | OpenAPI Specification\n--------------------------|-------------\nSubmission Service        | [services/submission/api_v1.json](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-server/raw/HEAD/services/submission/api_v1.json)\nDistribution Service      | [services/distribution/api_v1.json](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-server/raw/HEAD/services/distribution/api_v1.json)\n\n## Spring Profiles\n\n### Distribution\n\nSee [Distribution Service - Spring Profiles](/docs/DISTRIBUTION.md#spring-profiles).\n\n### Submission\n\nSee [Submission Service - Spring Profiles](/docs/SUBMISSION.md#spring-profiles).\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe full documentation for the Corona-Warn-App can be found in the [cwa-documentation](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation) repository.

  "readme_contents": "=APN on Rails (Apple Push Notifications on Rails)\n\nAPN on Rails is a Ruby on Rails gem that allows you to easily add Apple Push Notification (iPhone)\nsupport to your Rails application.  \n\nIt supports: \n* Multiple iPhone apps managed from the same Rails application as well as a legacy default \"app\" with certs stored in config\n* Individual notifications and group notifications\n* Alerts, badges, sounds, and custom properties in notifications\n* Pull notifications\n\n== Feature Descriptions\n\nMultiple iPhone Apps: In previous versions of this gem a single Rails application was set up to \nmanage push notifications for a single iPhone app.  In many cases it is useful to have a single Rails\napp manage push notifications for multiple iPhone apps.  With the addition of an APN::App model, this \nis now possible.  The certificates are now stored on instances of APN::App and devices are intended to be associated\nwith a particular app.  For compatibility with existing implementations it is still possible to create devices that \nare not associated with an APN::App and to send individual notifications to them using the certs stored in the \nconfig directory.  \n\nIndividual and Group Notifications: Previous versions of this gem treated each notification individually\nand did not provide a built-in way to send a broadcast notification to a group of devices.  Group notifications\nare now built into the gem.  A group notification is associated with a group of devices and shares its \ncontents across the entire group of devices.  (Group notifications are only available for groups of devices associated \nwith an APN::App)\n\nNotification Content Areas: Notifications may contain alerts, badges, sounds, and custom properties.\n\nPull Notifications: This version of the gem supports an alternative notification method that relies\non pulls from client devices and does not interact with the Apple Push Notification servers.  This feature\nmay be used entirely independently of the push notification features.  Pull notifications may be\ncreated for an app.  A client app can query for the most recent pull notification available since a \ngiven date to retrieve any notifications waiting for it. \n\n==Version 0.4.1 Notes\n\n* Backwards compatibility.  0.4.0 required a manual upgrade to associate existing and new devices with an APN::App model.  This version allows continued use of devices that are associated with a default \"app\" that stores its certificates in the config directory.  This ought to allow upgrade to this version without code changes.  \n* Batched finds.  Finds on the APN::Device model that can return large numbers of records have been batched to limit memory impact. \n* Custom properties migration.  At a pre-0.4.0 version the custom_properties attribute was added to the migration template that created the notifications table.  This introduced a potential problem for gem users who had previously run this migration.  The custom_properties alteration to the apn_notifications table has been moved to its own migration and should work regardless of whether your apn_notifications table already has a custom_properties attribute. \n* last_registered_at changed to work intuitively.  The last_registered_at attribute of devices was being updated only on creation potentially causing a bug in which a device that opts out of APNs and then opts back in before apn_on_rails received feedback about it might miss a period of APNs that it should receive.  \n\n==Acknowledgements:\n\nFrom Mark Bates: \n\nThis gem is a re-write of a plugin that was written by Fabien Penso and Sam Soffes.\nTheir plugin was a great start, but it just didn't quite reach the level I hoped it would.\nI've re-written, as a gem, added a ton of tests, and I would like to think that I made it\na little nicer and easier to use.\n\nFrom Rebecca Nesson (PRX.org): \n\nThis gem extends the original version that Mark Bates adapted.  His gem did the hard\nwork of setting up and handling all communication with the Apple push notification servers.\n\n==Converting Your Certificate:\n\nOnce you have the certificate from Apple for your application, export your key\nand the apple certificate as p12 files. Here is a quick walkthrough on how to do this:\n\n1. Click the disclosure arrow next to your certificate in Keychain Access and select the certificate and the key. \n2. Right click and choose `Export 2 items...`. \n3. Choose the p12 format from the drop down and name it `cert.p12`. \n\nNow covert the p12 file to a pem file:\n\n  $ openssl pkcs12 -in cert.p12 -out apple_push_notification_production.pem -nodes -clcerts\n\nIf you are using a development certificate, then change the name to apple_push_notification_development.pem instead.\n\nStore the contents of the certificate files on the app model for the app you want to send notifications to. \n\n==Installing:\n\n===Stable (RubyForge):\n\n  $ sudo gem install apn_on_rails\n\n===Edge (GitHub):\n\n  $ sudo gem install PRX-apn_on_rails.git --source=http://gems.github.com\n\n===Rails Gem Management:\n\nIf you like to use the built in Rails gem management:\n\n  config.gem 'apn_on_rails'\n\nOr, if you like to live on the edge:\n\n  config.gem 'PRX-apn_on_rails', :lib => 'apn_on_rails', :source => 'http://gems.github.com'\n\n==Setup and Configuration:\n\nOnce you have the gem installed via your favorite gem installation, you need to require it so you can\nstart to use it:\n\nAdd the following require, wherever it makes sense to you:\n\n  require 'apn_on_rails'\n\nYou also need to add the following to your Rakefile so you can use the\nRake tasks that ship with APN on Rails:\n\n  begin\n    require 'apn_on_rails_tasks'\n  rescue MissingSourceFile => e\n    puts e.message\n  end\n\nNow, to create the tables you need for APN on Rails, run the following task:\n\n  $ ruby script/generate apn_migrations\n\nAPN on Rails uses the Configatron gem, http://github.com/markbates/configatron/tree/master, \nto configure itself. (With the change to multi-app support, the certifications are stored in the \ndatabase rather than in the config directory, however, it is still possible to use the default \"app\" and the certificates\nstored in the config directory.  For this setup, the following configurations apply.) \nAPN on Rails has the following default configurations that you change as you see fit:\n\n  # development (delivery):\n  configatron.apn.passphrase # => ''\n  configatron.apn.port # => 2195\n  configatron.apn.host # => 'gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com'\n  configatron.apn.cert #=> File.join(RAILS_ROOT, 'config', 'apple_push_notification_development.pem')\n  \n  # production (delivery):\n  configatron.apn.host # => 'gateway.push.apple.com'\n  configatron.apn.cert #=> File.join(RAILS_ROOT, 'config', 'apple_push_notification_production.pem')\n  \n  # development (feedback):\n  configatron.apn.feedback.passphrase # => ''\n  configatron.apn.feedback.port # => 2196\n  configatron.apn.feedback.host # => 'feedback.sandbox.push.apple.com'\n  configatron.apn.feedback.cert #=> File.join(RAILS_ROOT, 'config', 'apple_push_notification_development.pem')\n  \n  # production (feedback):\n  configatron.apn.feedback.host # => 'feedback.push.apple.com'\n  configatron.apn.feedback.cert #=> File.join(RAILS_ROOT, 'config', 'apple_push_notification_production.pem')\n\nThat's it, now you're ready to start creating notifications.\n\n===Upgrade Notes:\n\nIf you are upgrading to a new version of APN on Rails you should always run:\n\n  $ ruby script/generate apn_migrations\n\nThat way you ensure you have the latest version of the database tables needed.\n\n==Example (assuming you have created an app and stored your keys on it):\n\n  $ ./script/console\n  >> app = APN::App.create(:name => \"My App\", :apn_dev_cert => \"PASTE YOUR DEV CERT HERE\", :apn_prod_cert => \"PASTE YOUR PROD CERT HERE\")\n  >> device = APN::Device.create(:token => \"XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX\",:app_id => app.id)\n  >> notification = APN::Notification.new\n  >> notification.device = device\n  >> notification.badge = 5\n  >> notification.sound = true\n  >> notification.alert = \"foobar\"\n  >> notification.custom_properties = {:link => \"http://www.prx.org\"}\n  >> notification.save\n\nYou can use the following Rake task to deliver your individual notifications:\n\n  $ rake apn:notifications:deliver\n\nAnd the following task to deliver your group notifications: \n\n  $ rake apn:group_notifications:deliver\n\nThe Rake task will find any unsent notifications in the database. If there aren't any notifications\nit will simply do nothing. If there are notifications waiting to be delivered it will open a single connection\nto Apple and push all the notifications through that one connection. Apple does not like people opening/closing\nconnections constantly, so it's pretty important that you are careful about batching up your notifications so\nApple doesn't shut you down.\n\nReleased under the MIT license.\n"

  "readme_contents": "\n# APFS FUSE Driver for Linux\n\nThis project is a read-only FUSE driver for the new Apple File System. It also supports software\nencrypted volumes and fusion drives. Firmlinks are not supported yet.\n\nBe aware that not all compression methods are supported yet (only the ones I have encountered so far).\nThus, the driver may return compressed files instead of uncompressed ones. Although most of the time it\nshould just report an error.\n\n## Changelog\n\n| Date | Comment |\n|------|---------|\n| 2020-07-08 | Added support for mounting snapshots and sealed volumes |\n| 2018-04-20 | Added support for mounting DMGs |\n| 2018-04-14 | Added support for partition tables (GPT only) |\n| 2018-04-10 | Fixed and extended FileVault encryption support |\n| 2018-03-28 | Added support for FileVault encryption |\n| 2017-10-25 | Added support for encryption |\n| 2017-10-14 | Initial version |\n\n## Usage\n\n### Compile the source code\nThe following libraries are needed (including the -dev/-devel packages):\n\n* FUSE 2.6 or greater (on 32-bit systems, FUSE 3.0 or greater)\n* zlib\n* bzip2\n* libattr (on some Linux distributions)\n\nDevelopment tools:\n* cmake\n* gcc-c++ (or clang++)\n* git (for cloning)\n\nExample for Linux:\n```\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install fuse libfuse3-dev bzip2 libbz2-dev cmake gcc-c++ git libattr1-dev zlib1g-dev\n```\nOf course these commands depend on the Linux distribution.\n\nClone the repository:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/sgan81/apfs-fuse.git\ncd apfs-fuse\ngit submodule init\ngit submodule update\n```\nThe driver uses Apple's lzfse library and includes it as a submodule.\n\nCompile the driver:\n```\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\nccmake . # Only if you want to change build options\nmake\n```\n\nNote that the driver uses FUSE 3.0 by default (required on 32-bit systems). If\nyou want do compile using FUSE 2.6, use `ccmake .` to change the option\n`USE_FUSE3` to `OFF`.\n\n### Mount a drive\n```\napfs-fuse <device> <mount-directory>\n```\n#### Supported options:\n* `-d n`: If n > 0, enable debug output (see below for details).\n* `-f device`: Specify secondary device for Fusion drive.\n* `-o opts`: Comma-separated list of mount options.\n* `-l`: Lax mode: when unexpected data is encountered, try to continue, even if this means\n  returning potentially incorrect data.\n* `-v n`: Instead of mounting the first volume in a container, mount volume n (starting at 0).\n* `-r recovery_key`: Mount an encrypted volume by supplying a password or Personal Recovery Key (PRK).\n* `-s n`: Find the container at offset n inside the device. This is useful when using an image file\n  instead of a disk device, and therefore partitions are not exposed.\n* `-p n`: Find the container at partition n inside the device.\n\nIf you are using an image file containing partitions, the driver will now detect if there is a valid GPT\npartition table. If there is, it will look for the first APFS partition and use that one for the container.\nIf your drive contains more than one APFS container, you can specify the partition/container id with the\n`-p` option.\n\nThe device has to be the one containing the APFS container. If a container contains more than one volume,\nthe volume can be specified by the `-v` option.\n\nIf a volume is encrypted, the apfs-fuse command will prompt for a password, unless a password or PRK is\nspecified on the command line. The PRK can also be used as password.\n\nIt is also possible to directly mount DMG files. The driver will automatically detect if a dmg\nhas to be mounted and take appropriate action. If a dmg is encrypted, you will be asked for the password.\nNote that dmg support is currently a bit slow (especially when compressed), but it should work properly.\n\nThe debug flags are now a combination of bits. So to enable specific output, you just add the numbers\nmentioned below together, and use the result as parameter for -d.\n\n* 1 Display more information about errors\n* 2 Display additional generic information\n* 4 Display information about directory-related operations\n* 8 Display information about on-the-fly compression\n* 16 Display information about cryptographic operations (caution, displays keys as well)\n\n#### Mount options (-o ...)\nIn addition to the mount options supported by fuse, the following mount options are supported:\n* uid=n: Pretend that all files have UID n.\n* gid=n: Pretend that all files have GID n.\n* vol=n: Same as -v, specify the volume number to mount if you don't want volume 0.\n* blksize=n: Set the physical block size (default: 512 bytes).\n* pass=...: Specify volume passphrase (same as -r).\n* xid=...: Try to mount older XID. May be useful if the container is corrupt.\n* snap=...: Mount snapshot with given XID. Use apfsutil to display snapshot ids.\n\nThe blksize parameter is required for proper partition table parsing on some newer\nmacs. However the current driver should be able to detect the block size automatically.\n\nIf you mount a volume as root and want some user to be able to access it, use:\n```\napfs-fuse -o uid=<uid>,gid=<gid>,allow_other /dev/<device> <mount-path>\n```\n\nIf you want to mount a device as user, add yourself to the disk group. This might not be too safe though,\nas it allows any application to read and write anywhere on a drive.\n\n### Unmount a drive\nAs root:\n```\numount <mount-directory>\n```\n\nAs user:\n```\nfusermount -u <mount-directory>\n```\n\n## Features\nThe following features are implemented:\n\n* Can read macOS 10.13 case sensitive and insensitive volumes, as well as iOS 11 / macOS 10.12 volumes\n* Transparent decompression of ZLib and LZVN\n* Symlinks\n* Hardlinks (it seems ...)\n* Extended attributes\n* Software encryption (at least full-disk encryption)\n* Automatic detection of GPT partition tables\n* Direct mounting of DMG images (supports zlib/adc compression and encryption)\n\n## Limitations\nThese things are not supported (yet):\n\n* Transparent decompression of LZFSE\n* Writing\n* Hardware-encrypted volumes (internal drives of Macs with T2 chip)\n\n## Debugging\n\nSince the driver is still experimental and based on analysis of a limited set of drives / volumes, crashes\nmay unfortunately still happen. If a crash happens, providing me with useful information can be very helpful.\n\nOne of the most important pieces of information is the location where the program crashed. You can find that\nout by debugging the tool. In order to debug the program, do the following:\n\nChange the main CMakeLists.txt as follows: In the line `set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Release)`,\nreplace `Release` with `Debug`.\n\nRebuild everything.\n\nRun it under `gdb`. Like this:\n```\ngdb apfs-fuse\n\n(In gdb):\nset args <options> <device> <mount-directory>\nrun\n\n(And if/when it crashes):\nbacktrace\n\n(When you're finished):\nquit\n```\nAnd then send the output of `backtrace` to me. Adding `-d 1` to options might help as well, but be aware that\nit will generate a lot of output on the text console.\n\n### Some tools that might be useful\n#### apfs-dump-quick\n\nIf you encounter problems with some file, it may be that I overlooked something during reverse engineering. In that\ncase, you can use the `apfs-dump-quick` command to dump the management structures of the whole drive. It can be run\nas follows:\n```\napfs-dump-quick <drive> <logfile.txt>\n```\nThe tool will dump the most current version of the disk structures into a logfile. This file can become quite big, like\na few 100 MB. So to limit the amount of information to report, look for the name of the file in the log. Try to find a\nline starting with `File` and containing the filename. The number immediately after `File` is the ID. Find all lines\nhaving this ID, and include them in your bug report.\n#### apfs-dump\nThere is another command available:\n```\napfs-dump <drive> <logfile.txt>\n```\nThis tool was the one I originally used for reverse engineering. It will scan the whole volume for clusters having\ncorrect checksums (and thus being part of some management structure), and then it will try to dump them. This will\ntake a very long time to run on big volumes, and create huge log files. So using the quick version will be much faster.\n#### apfsutil\n```\napfsutil <device>\n```\nThis is a new tool that just displays some information from a container. For now, it lists the volumes a container\ncontains, and snapshots if there are some. This tool might be extended in the future.\n"

This is an example you can find at `test/test.config`:\n\n```erlang\n{\n  apns,\n  [ {apple_host,       \"api.development.push.apple.com\"}\n  , {apple_port,       443}\n  , {certfile,         \"priv/apns-dev-cert.pem\"}\n  , {keyfile,          \"priv/apns-dev-key-noenc.pem\"}\n  , {token_keyfile,    \"priv/APNsAuthKey_KEYID12345.p8\"}\n  , {timeout,          10000}\n\n  %% APNs Headers\n\n  , {apns_id,          undefined}\n  , {apns_expiration,  0}\n  , {apns_priority,    10}\n  , {apns_topic,       \"com.example.myapp\"}\n  , {apns_collapse_id, undefined}\n  , {apns_push_type,   \"alert\"}\n\n  %% Feedback\n  , {feedback_host,    \"feedback.push.apple.com\"}\n  , {feedback_port,    2195}\n  ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe other way is send all that info as a parameter to `apns:connect/1` function encapsulated in a `apns_connection:connection()` structure:\n\n```erlang\n#{ name       := name()\n , apple_host := host()\n , apple_port := inet:port_number()\n , certfile   => path()\n , keyfile    => path()\n , timeout    => integer()\n , type       := type()\n }.\n```\n\nAPNs allows two connection types, one is using `Provider Certificates`. The first certificate option is to supply cert paths in `certfile` and `keyfile`. Alternatively, you can supply a cert binary in `certdata` and a `keydata()`-type tuple (see: https://github.com/inaka/apns4erl/blob/master/src/apns_connection.erl#L64) in `keydata`. Certs are the `Provider Certificates` and the keys are the `Private Key` both provided by Apple. We need them in `.pem` format, here is an example of how to convert them, check the [certificates](https://blog.serverdensity.com/how-to-build-an-apple-push-notification-provider-server-tutorial/) section.\n\nThe other way to connect against APNs is using `Provider Authentication Tokens`, for this choice you must fill the field `token_keyfile`. This is a path to the Authentication Key provided by Apple. This is in `.p8` format and it doesn't need conversion.\n\nThis `key` will be needed in order to generate a token which will be used every time we try to push a notification. In connection's time it is not needed.\n\n## Run\n\n`apns4erl` can be included as a dependency and started from `yourapp.app.src`. You also can run it on the shell for testing.\n\n```\n> rebar3 compile\n> erl -pa _build/default/lib/*/ebin -config test/test.config\n```\nDon't forget your config file if you want to use `apns:connect/2`.\n```erlang\n1> apns:start().\nok\n```\n\n## Create connections\n\nAfter running `apns4erl` app we can start creating connections. As we mentioned before there are two types of connections. Both are created using the functions `apns:connect/1` and `apns:connect/2`.\n\n- `apns:connect/1`: This function accepts as a parameter an `apns_connection:connection()` structure.\n  ```erlang\n  #{ name       := name()\n   , apple_host := host()\n   , apple_port := inet:port_number()\n   , certdata   => binary()\n   , certfile   => path()\n   , keydata    => keydata()\n   , keyfile    => path()\n   , timeout    => integer()\n   , type       := type()\n   }.\n  ```\n  where the `type` field indicates if is `certdata`, `cert`, or `token`.\n\n- `apns:connect/2`: The first argument is the type and the second one is the connection's name. In order to use it successfully we have to fill the `config` file before, as explained in `how to use it?` section.\n\nExample:\n\n```erlang\n1> apns:connect(cert, my_first_connection).\n{ok,<0.87.0>}\n2> apns:connect(#{name => another_cert, apple_host => \"api.push.apple.com\", apple_port => 443,\ncertfile => \"priv/cert.pem\", keyfile => \"priv/key.pem\", type => cert}).\n3> apns:connect(token, my_second_connection).\n{ok,<0.95.0>}\n```\nNote `cert` and `token` define the type we want.\n\n`apns:connect/2` returns the connection `pid`.\n\n## Create Connections without name\n\nIn some scenarios we don't want to assign names to the connections instead we want working just with the `pid` (working with a pool of connections for example). If that is the case we use the same `apns:connect/1` and `apns:connect/2` functions but instead of a connection name we put `undefined`:\n\n```erlang\n1> apns:connect(cert, undefined).\n{ok,<0.127.0>}\n2> apns:connect(#{name => undefined, apple_host => \"api.push.apple.com\", apple_port => 443,\ncertfile => \"priv/cert2.pem\", keyfile => \"priv/key2-noenc.pem\", type => cert}).\n{ok,<0.130.0>}\n3> apns:connect(token, my_second_connection).\n{ok,<0.132.0>}\n```\n\n## Push Notifications over `Provider Certificate` connections\n\nIn order to send Notifications over `Provider Certificate` connection we will use `apns:push_notification/3,4`.\n\nWe will need the connection, a notification, the device ID and some http2 headers. The connection is the `atom` we used when we executed `apns:connect/2` for setting a name or its `pid`, the device ID is provided by Apple, the notification is a `map` with the data we want to send, that map will be encoded to json later and the http2 headers can be explicitly sent as a parameter using `apns:push_notification/4` or can be defined at the `config` file, in that case we would use `apns:push_notification/3`.\n\nThis is the `headers` format:\n\n```erlang\n-type headers()   :: #{ apns_id          => binary()\n                      , apns_expiration  => binary()\n                      , apns_priority    => binary()\n                      , apns_topic       => binary()\n                      , apns_collapse_id => binary()\n                      , apns_push_type   => binary()\n                      , apns_auth_token  => binary()\n                      }.\n```\n\nAll of them are defined by Apple  [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/CommunicatingwithAPNs.html)\n\nLets send a Notification.\n\n```erlang\n1> {ok, Pid} = apns:connect(cert, my_first_connection).\n{ok,<0.85.0>}\n2> DeviceId = <<\"a0dc63fb059cb9c13b03e5c974af3dd33d67fed4147da8c5ada0626439e18935\">>.\n<<\"a0dc63fb059cb9c13b03e5c974af3dd33d67fed4147da8c5ada0626439e18935\">>\n3> Notification = #{aps => #{alert => <<\"you have a message\">>}}.\n#{aps => #{alert => <<\"you have a message\">>}}\n4> apns:push_notification(my_first_connection, DeviceId, Notification).\n{200,\n [{<<\"apns-id\">>,<<\"EFDE0D9D-F60C-30F4-3FF1-86F3B90BE434\">>}],\n no_body}\n5> apns:push_notification(Pid, DeviceId, Notification).\n{200,\n [{<<\"apns-id\">>,<<\"EFDE0D9D-F60C-30F4-3FF1-86F3B90BE654\">>}],\n no_body}\n```\n\nThe result is the response itself, its format is:\n\n```erlang\n-type response()  :: { integer()          % HTTP2 Code\n                     , [term()]           % Response Headers\n                     , [term()] | no_body % Response Body\n                     } | timeout.\n```\n\nAnd that's all.\n\n## Push Notifications over `Provider Authentication Tokens` connections\n\nThis is the other way APNs allows us to send notifications. In this case we don't need a certificate but we will need a `p8` file with the private key we will use to sign the token. Lets assume we've got the file  `APNsAuthKey_KEYID12345.p8` from Apple. We then have to fill the `config` file key `token_keyfile` with the path to that file.\n\nWe will need a `kid` value, this is the key identifier. In our case is the last 10 chars of the file name (`KEYID123456`). We will need also the `iss` value, this is the Team Id, that can be checked on your Apple's Developer account, in our case it will be `THEATEAM`. And that's it.\n\nYou can find more info [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/CommunicatingwithAPNs.html)\n\nIn order to push a notification we will use `apns:push_notification_token/4,5`. We will need the same attributes we used sending a notification over `Provider Certificate` connections plus a signed `token`. This token has a 1 hour life, so that means we can generate one token and use it many times till it expires. Lets try.\n\nCreate the token:\n\n```erlang\n6> TeamId = <<\"THEATEAM\">>.\n<<\"THEATEAM\">>\n7> KeyID = <<\"KEYID123456\">>.\n<<\"KEYID123456\">>\n8> Token = apns:generate_token(TeamId, KeyID).\n<<\"eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6IktFWUlEMTIzNDU2In0.eyJpc3MiOiJUSEVBVEVBTSIsImlhdCI6MTQ4NjE0OTMzNH0.MEQC\"...>>\n```\n\nNow push the notification:\n\n```erlang\n12> DeviceId = <<\"a0dc63fb059cb9c13b03e5c974af3dd33d67fed4147da8c5ada0626439e18935\">>.\n<<\"a0dc63fb059cb9c13b03e5c974af3dd33d67fed4147da8c5ada0626439e18935\">>\n13> Notification = #{aps => #{alert => <<\"you have a message\">>}}.\n#{aps => #{alert => <<\"you have a message\">>}}\n14> apns:push_notification_token(my_second_connection, Token, DeviceId, Notification).\n{200,\n [{<<\"apns-id\">>,<<\"EBC03BF9-A784-FDED-34F7-5A8D859DA977\">>}],\n no_body}\n```\n\nWe can use this token for an entire hour, after that we will receive something like this:\n\n```erlang\n16> apns:push_notification_token(my_second_connection, Token, DeviceId, Notification).\n{403,\n [{<<\"apns-id\">>,<<\"03FF9497-8A6B-FFD6-B32B-160ACEDE35F0\">>}],\n [{<<\"reason\">>,<<\"ExpiredProviderToken\">>}]}\n```\n\n## Pushing notifications\n\n*NOTE* in order to push notifications, in both ways, we _must_ call `apns:push_notification/3,4` and `apns:push_notification_token/4,5` from the same\nprocess which created the connection. If we try to do it from a different one we will get an error `{error, not_connection_owner}`.\n\n## Reconnection\n\nIf network goes down or something unexpected happens the `gun` connection with APNs will go down. In that case `apns4erl` will send a message `{reconnecting, ServerPid}` to the client process, that means `apns4erl` lost the connection and it is trying to reconnect. Once the connection has been recover a `{connection_up, ServerPid}` message will be send.\n\n\nWe implemented an *Exponential Backoff* strategy. We can set the *ceiling* time adding the `backoff_ceiling` variable on the `config` file. By default it is set to 10 (seconds).\n\n## Close connections\n\nApple recommends us to keep our connections open and avoid opening and closing very often. You can check the [Best Practices for Managing Connections](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/CommunicatingwithAPNs.html) section.\n\nBut when closing a connection makes sense `apns4erl` gives us the function `apns:close_connection/1` where the parameter is the connection's name or the connection's `pid`. After using it the name will be available for new connections again (if it was different than `undefined`).\n\n## Feedback\n\n`apns4erl` also allows us to get feedback from APNs service. It does it thru the [binary API](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/BinaryProviderAPI.html).\n\nIn order to get feedback we would need a `Provider Certificate`. `apns4erl` provides us two functions, `apns:get_feedback/0` and `apns:get_feedback/1` which require some Feedback's information like url, port, timeout...  We can set that info in our `config` file and use `apns:get_feedback/0`. We can also send all that configuration as a parameter to `apns:get_feedback/1` where the config structure must looks like this:\n```erlang\n#{ host     := string()\n , port     := pos_integer()\n , certfile := string()\n , keyfile  => string()\n , timeout  := pos_integer()\n }.\n```\nThe response for both functions will be a list of `feedback()`\n\n```erlang\n-type feedback() :: {calendar:datetime(), string()}.\n```\nWhere the first element in the tuple is the date when the device uninstalled the app and the second element is the Device Id.\n\n### Changelog Generation\nIf you want to generate a new release of this project, you'll need to update the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file. We generally do it using `github_changelog_generator`. This project needs a special option passed to it, tho: `--exclude-tags-regex '1*'`. Otherwise, it will fail since version 2 releases started from a clean HEAD and therefore have nothing in common with the ones for version 1.\n"

However, the team size has gone the other way. We went from having 13+ developers on the team to 1 developer and 1 designer, both of whom have lives and projects outside of Popcorn Time. We have decided that we have given our all to this project and it's time for us to move on to pursue greater things. There is no doubt that this comes with a heavy heart as we have learned so much from this project and watched it grow from this simple torrenting app that could only play 720p video, to what it is today.\n\nAll that being said, we do not want this project to just die after we leave. The size of the project might be a bit daunting to an unseasoned developer but the app is extremely stable and packed with almost every feature you could need, so unless you're planning on doing a rewrite, it should be OK.\n\nipas are available for download and will remain working as per.

  "readme_contents": "# React Native Touch ID\n\n[![react-native version](https://img.shields.io/badge/react--native-0.57-green.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases)\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-native-touch-id.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-touch-id)\n[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/react-native-touch-id.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-touch-id)\n[![Code Climate](https://img.shields.io/codeclimate/github/naoufal/react-native-touch-id.svg?style=flat-square)](https://codeclimate.com/github/naoufal/react-native-touch-id)\n\nReact Native Touch ID is a [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) library for authenticating users with biometric authentication methods like Face ID and Touch ID on both iOS and Android (experimental).\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Note: **This library is not currently actively maintained.** If you're looking for something more stable that \"just works\", the awesome folks over at [Expo](https://expo.io) have begun open-sourcing some of their modules for compatability with React Native projects not built with Expo. As such you can attempt to use their equivalent library called [LocalAuthentication](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v30.0.0/sdk/local-authentication) at [expo-local-authentication](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-local-authentication) if you run into any issues here!\n\n![react-native-touch-id](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1627824/7975919/2c69a776-0a42-11e5-9773-3ea1c7dd79f3.gif)\n\n#### Breaking changes\n\nPlease review all changes in the [Changelog](https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-touch-id/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Install](https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-touch-id#install)\n- [Usage](https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-touch-id#usage)\n- [Example](https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-touch-id#example)\n- [Fallback](https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-touch-id#fallback)\n- [Methods](https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-touch-id#methods)\n- [Errors](https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-touch-id#errors)\n- [License](https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-touch-id#license)\n\n## Install\n\n```shell\nnpm i --save react-native-touch-id\n```\n\nor\n\n```shell\nyarn add react-native-touch-id\n```\n\n## Support\n\nDue to the rapid changes being made in the React Native ecosystem, we are not officially going to support this module on anything but the latest version of React Native. The current supported version is indicated on the React Native badge at the top of this README. If it's out of date, we encourage you to submit a pull request!\n\n## Usage\n\n### Linking the Library\n\nIn order to use Biometric Authentication, you must first link the library to your project.\n\n#### Using react-native link\n\nUse the built-in command:\n\n```shell\nreact-native link react-native-touch-id\n```\n\n#### Using Cocoapods (iOS only)\n\nOn iOS you can also link package by updating your podfile\n\n```ruby\npod 'TouchID', :path => \"#{node_modules_path}/react-native-touch-id\"\n```\n\nand then run\n\n```shell\npod install\n```\n\n#### Using native linking\n\nThere's excellent documentation on how to do this in the [React Native Docs](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html#content).\n\n### Platform Differences\n\niOS and Android differ slightly in their TouchID authentication.\n\nOn Android you can customize the title and color of the pop-up by passing in the **optional config object** with a color and title key to the `authenticate` method. Even if you pass in the config object, iOS **does not** allow you change the color nor the title of the pop-up. iOS does support `passcodeFallback` as an option, which when set to `true` will allow users to use their device pin - useful for people with Face / Touch ID disabled. Passcode fallback only happens if the device does not have touch id or face id enabled.\n\nError handling is also different between the platforms, with iOS currently providing much more descriptive error codes.\n\n### App Permissions\n\nAdd the following permissions to their respective files:\n\nIn your `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.USE_FINGERPRINT\" />\n```\n\nIn your `Info.plist`:\n\n```xml\n<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>\n<string>Enabling Face ID allows you quick and secure access to your account.</string>\n```\n\n### Requesting Face ID/Touch ID Authentication\n\nOnce you've linked the library, you'll want to make it available to your app by requiring it:\n\n```js\nvar TouchID = require('react-native-touch-id');\n```\n\nor\n\n```js\nimport TouchID from 'react-native-touch-id';\n```\n\nRequesting Face ID/Touch ID Authentication is as simple as calling:\n\n```js\nTouchID.authenticate('to demo this react-native component', optionalConfigObject)\n  .then(success => {\n    // Success code\n  })\n  .catch(error => {\n    // Failure code\n  });\n```\n\n## Example\n\nUsing Face ID/Touch ID in your app will usually look like this:\n\n```js\nimport React from \"react\"\nvar TouchID = require('react-native-touch-id');\n//or import TouchID from 'react-native-touch-id'\n\nclass YourComponent extends React.Component {\n  _pressHandler() {\n    TouchID.authenticate('to demo this react-native component', optionalConfigObject)\n      .then(success => {\n        AlertIOS.alert('Authenticated Successfully');\n      })\n      .catch(error => {\n        AlertIOS.alert('Authentication Failed');\n      });\n  },\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View>\n        ...\n        <TouchableHighlight onPress={this._pressHandler}>\n          <Text>\n            Authenticate with Touch ID\n          </Text>\n        </TouchableHighlight>\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## Methods\n\n### authenticate(reason, config)\n\nAttempts to authenticate with Face ID/Touch ID.\nReturns a `Promise` object.\n\n**Arguments**\n\n- `reason` - **optional** - `String` that provides a clear reason for requesting authentication.\n\n- `config` - **optional** - configuration object for more detailed dialog setup:\n  - `title` - **Android** - title of confirmation dialog\n  - `imageColor` - **Android** - color of fingerprint image\n  - `imageErrorColor` - **Android** - color of fingerprint image after failed attempt\n  - `sensorDescription` - **Android** - text shown next to the fingerprint image\n  - `sensorErrorDescription` - **Android** - text shown next to the fingerprint image after failed attempt\n  - `cancelText` - **Android** - cancel button text\n  - `fallbackLabel` - **iOS** - by default specified 'Show Password' label. If set to empty string label is invisible.\n  - `unifiedErrors` - return unified error messages (see below) (default = false)\n  - `passcodeFallback` - **iOS** - by default set to false. If set to true, will allow use of keypad passcode.\n\n**Examples**\n\n```js\nconst optionalConfigObject = {\n  title: 'Authentication Required', // Android\n  imageColor: '#e00606', // Android\n  imageErrorColor: '#ff0000', // Android\n  sensorDescription: 'Touch sensor', // Android\n  sensorErrorDescription: 'Failed', // Android\n  cancelText: 'Cancel', // Android\n  fallbackLabel: 'Show Passcode', // iOS (if empty, then label is hidden)\n  unifiedErrors: false, // use unified error messages (default false)\n  passcodeFallback: false, // iOS - allows the device to fall back to using the passcode, if faceid/touch is not available. this does not mean that if touchid/faceid fails the first few times it will revert to passcode, rather that if the former are not enrolled, then it will use the passcode.\n};\n\nTouchID.authenticate('to demo this react-native component', optionalConfigObject)\n  .then(success => {\n    AlertIOS.alert('Authenticated Successfully');\n  })\n  .catch(error => {\n    AlertIOS.alert('Authentication Failed');\n  });\n```\n\n### isSupported()\n\nReturns a `Promise` that rejects if TouchID is not supported. On iOS resolves with a `biometryType` `String` of `FaceID` or `TouchID`.\n\n**Examples**\n\n```js\nconst optionalConfigObject = {\n  unifiedErrors: false // use unified error messages (default false)\n  passcodeFallback: false // if true is passed, itwill allow isSupported to return an error if the device is not enrolled in touch id/face id etc. Otherwise, it will just tell you what method is supported, even if the user is not enrolled.  (default false)\n}\n\nTouchID.isSupported(optionalConfigObject)\n  .then(biometryType => {\n    // Success code\n    if (biometryType === 'FaceID') {\n        console.log('FaceID is supported.');\n    } else {\n        console.log('TouchID is supported.');\n    }\n  })\n  .catch(error => {\n    // Failure code\n    console.log(error);\n  });\n```\n\n## Errors\n\nThere are various reasons why biomentric authentication may not be available or fail. `TouchID.isSupported` and `TouchID.authenticate` will return an error representing the reason.\n\n#### iOS Errors\n\nFormat:\n\n```\n{\n  name: \"TheErrorCode\",\n  message: \"the error message\",\n  details: {\n    name: \"TheErrorCode\",\n    message: \"the error message\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n| name                          | message                                                                                                                              |\n| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `LAErrorAuthenticationFailed` | Authentication was not successful because the user failed to provide valid credentials.                                              |\n| `LAErrorUserCancel`           | Authentication was canceled by the user\u2014for example, the user tapped Cancel in the dialog.                                           |\n| `LAErrorUserFallback`         | Authentication was canceled because the user tapped the fallback button (Enter Password).                                            |\n| `LAErrorSystemCancel`         | Authentication was canceled by system\u2014for example, if another application came to foreground while the authentication dialog was up. |\n| `LAErrorPasscodeNotSet`       | Authentication could not start because the passcode is not set on the device.                                                        |\n| `LAErrorTouchIDNotAvailable`  | Authentication could not start because Touch ID is not available on the device                                                       |\n| `LAErrorTouchIDNotEnrolled`   | Authentication could not start because Touch ID has no enrolled fingers.                                                             |\n| `LAErrorTouchIDLockout`       | Authentication failed because of too many failed attempts.                                                                               |\n| `RCTTouchIDUnknownError`      | Could not authenticate for an unknown reason.                                                                                        |\n| `RCTTouchIDNotSupported`      | Device does not support Touch ID.                                                                                                    |\n\n_More information on errors can be found in [Apple's Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/LocalAuthentication/Reference/LAContext_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/c/tdef/LAError)._\n\n#### Android errors\n\nFormat:\n\n```\n{\n  name: \"Touch ID Error\",\n  message: \"Touch ID Error\",\n  details: \"the error message\",\n  code: \"THE_ERROR_CODE\"\n}\n```\n\nisSupported:\n\n| name             | message          | details        | code            |\n| ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | --------------- |\n| `Touch ID Error` | `Touch ID Error` | Not supported. | `NOT_SUPPORTED` |\n| `Touch ID Error` | `Touch ID Error` | Not supported. | `NOT_AVAILABLE` |\n| `Touch ID Error` | `Touch ID Error` | Not supported. | `NOT_PRESENT`   |\n| `Touch ID Error` | `Touch ID Error` | Not supported. | `NOT_ENROLLED`  |\n\nauthenticate:\n\n| name             | message          | details                                         | code                                   |\n| ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| `Touch ID Error` | `Touch ID Error` | Not supported                                   | `NOT_SUPPORTED`                        |\n| `Touch ID Error` | `Touch ID Error` | Not supported                                   | `NOT_AVAILABLE`                        |\n| `Touch ID Error` | `Touch ID Error` | Not supported                                   | `NOT_PRESENT`                          |\n| `Touch ID Error` | `Touch ID Error` | Not supported                                   | `NOT_ENROLLED`                         |\n| `Touch ID Error` | `Touch ID Error` | failed                                          | `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED`                |\n| `Touch ID Error` | `Touch ID Error` | cancelled                                       | `AUTHENTICATION_CANCELED`              |\n| `Touch ID Error` | `Touch ID Error` | Too many attempts.

the rest will default to the values\n# shown here.\n#\n# Information on obtaining a `.pem` file for use with `certificate` is shown\n# later.\npusher = Grocer.pusher(\n  certificate: \"/path/to/cert.pem\",      # required\n  passphrase:  \"\",                       # optional\n  gateway:     \"gateway.push.apple.com\", # optional;

used for custom notification actions\n  sound:             \"siren.aiff\",         # optional\n  expiry:            Time.now + 60*60,     # optional; 0 is default, meaning the message is not stored\n  identifier:        1234,                 # optional; must be an integer\n  content_available: true,                 # optional; any truthy value will set 'content-available' to 1\n  mutable_content:   true                  # optional; any truthy value will set 'mutable-content' to 1\n)\n\npusher.push(notification) # return value is the number of bytes sent successfully\n```\n\nIt is desirable to reuse the same connection to send multiple notifications, as is recommended by Apple.\n\n```ruby\npusher = Grocer.pusher(connection_options)\nnotifications.each do |notification|\n  pusher.push(notification)\nend\n```\n\n#### Custom Payloads\n\nThe Apple documentation says \"Providers can specify custom payload values outside the Apple-reserved aps namespace.\"\nTo specify a custom payload, set `Grocer::Notification#custom`.\n\n```ruby\nnotification = Grocer::Notification.new(\n  device_token: \"...\",\n  alert:        \"Hello from Grocer\",\n  custom: {\n    \"acme2\": [\"bang\", \"whiz\"]\n  }\n)\n\n# Generates a JSON payload like:\n# {\"aps\": {\"alert\": \"Hello from Grocer\"}, \"acme2\": [\"bang\", \"whiz\"]}\n```\n\n#### Passbook Notifications\n\nA `Grocer::PassbookNotification` is a specialized kind of notification which does not require any payload.\nThat is, you need not (and *[Apple explicitly says not to](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#Documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/PassKit_PG/Chapters/Updating.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012195-CH5-SW1)*) send any payload for a Passbook notification.\nIf you do, it will be ignored.\n\n```ruby\nnotification = Grocer::PassbookNotification.new(device_token: \"...\")\n# Generates a JSON payload like:\n# {\"aps\": {}}\n```\n\n#### Newsstand Notifications\n\nGrocer also supports the special Newsstand 'content-available' notification.\n`Grocer::NewsstandNotification` can be used for this.\nLike `Grocer::PassbookNotification`, it is a specialized kind of notification which does not require any payload.\nLikewise, anything you add to it will be ignored.\n\n```ruby\nnotification = Grocer::NewsstandNotification.new(device_token: \"...\")\n# Generates a JSON payload like:\n# {\"aps\": {\"content-available\":1}}\n```\n\n#### Safari Notifications\n\nGrocer can be used for [Safari Push Notifications](https://developer.apple.com/notifications/safari-push-notifications/) introduced in Mavericks.\n\n```ruby\nnotification = Grocer::SafariNotification.new(\n  device_token: '...',        # required\n  title: 'Hello from Grocer', # required\n  body: 'Hi',                 # required\n  action: 'Read',             # optional; the label of the action button\n  url_args: ['arg1']          # required (array); values that are paired with the placeholders inside the urlFormatString.\n)\n```\n\nGenerates a JSON payload like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aps\": {\n    \"alert\": {\n      \"title\": \"Hello from Grocer\",\n      \"body\": \"Hi\",\n      \"action\": \"Read\"\n    },\n    \"url-args\": [ \"arg1\" ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Feedback\n\n```ruby\n# `certificate` is the only required option; the rest will default to the values\n# shown here.\nfeedback = Grocer.feedback(\n  certificate: \"/path/to/cert.pem\",       # required\n  passphrase:  \"\",                        # optional\n  gateway:     \"feedback.push.apple.com\", # optional; See note below.\n  port:        2196,                      # optional\n  retries:     3                          # optional\n)\n\nfeedback.each do |attempt|\n  puts \"Device #{attempt.device_token} failed at #{attempt.timestamp}\"\nend\n```\n\n#### Notes\n\n* `gateway`: Defaults to `feedback.push.apple.com` **only** when running in a production environment, as determined by either the `RAILS_ENV` or `RACK_ENV` environment variables.\n  In all other cases, it defaults to the sandbox gateway, `feedback.sandbox.push.apple.com`.\n* `retries`: The number of times **grocer** will retry writing to or reading from the Apple Push Notification Service before raising any errors to client code.\n\n### Acceptance Testing\n\nGrocer ships with framework to setup a real looking APNS server.\nIt listens on a real SSL-capable socket bound to localhost.\nSee the [Connecting Notes](#notes) above for details.\n\nYou can setup an APNS client to talk to it, then inspect the notifications the server received.\n\nThe server simply exposes a blocking queue where notifications are placed when they are received.\nIt is your responsibility to timeout if a message is not received in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nFor example, in RSpec:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'timeout'\n\ndescribe \"apple push notifications\" do\n  before do\n    @server = Grocer.server(port: 2195)\n    @server.accept # starts listening in background\n  end\n\n  after do\n    @server.close\n  end\n\n  specify \"As a user, I receive notifications on my phone when awesome things happen\" do\n    # ... exercise code that would send APNS notifications ...\n\n    Timeout.timeout(3) {\n      notification = @server.notifications.pop # blocking\n      expect(notification.alert).to eq(\"An awesome thing happened\")\n    }\n  end\nend\n```\n\n## Device Token\n\nA device token is obtained from within the iOS app.\nMore details are in Apple's [Registering for Remote Notifications](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/IPhoneOSClientImp/IPhoneOSClientImp.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH103-SW1) documentation.\n\nThe key code for this purpose is:\n\n```objective-c\n- (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(UIApplication *)app {\n   // other setup tasks here....\n   [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:(UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert | UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge | UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound)];\n}\n\n- (void)application:(UIApplication *)app didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)devToken {\n    NSLog(@\"Got device token: %@\", [devToken description]);\n\n    [self sendProviderDeviceToken:[devToken bytes]]; // custom method; e.g., send to a web service and store\n}\n\n- (void)application:(UIApplication *)app didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError *)err {\n    NSLog(@\"Error in registration. Error: %@\", err);\n}\n```\n\n## Certificate File\n\nLogin to the [iOS Provisioning Portal (App IDs)](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifier/bundle).\n\nSelect your app bundle, scroll down and click \"Edit.\"\nThis will bring you to a page that will allow you to setup and configure services for your app.\nScroll down until you see the service labeled \"Push Notifications.\"\nDepending on whether you\u2019re creating a Development or Production certificate, click the appropriate \"Create Certificate\" button.\n\n![Creating the Push Notification\nCertificate](images/Creating_the_Push_Notification_Certificate.png)\n\nFollow the instructions to create a Certificate Signing Request, click \"Continue,\" upload the CSR, and download the resulting `.cer` file.\n\nOpen the `.cer` file in Keychain Access, then expand the certificate to show both the certificate *and* the private key.\nCommand-select so both are highlighted:\n\n![Selecting both the certificate and private key](images/Selecting_both_the_certificate_and_private_key.png)\n\nControl click and select to export the 2 items:\n\n![Exporting the certificate and private key](images/Exporting_the_certificate_and_private_key.png)\n\nSave the items as a `.p12` file.\nOpen a terminal window and run the following command:\n\n```bash\nopenssl pkcs12 -in exported_certificate.p12 -out certificate.pem -nodes -clcerts -des3\n```\n\nYou will be prompted for two password.\nThe first one is the password that you used when you exported the private key and certificate from Keychain Access.\nThe second password will be used to encrypt and lock the private key.\nThis will be the passphrase used when configuring **grocer** to connect to APNs.\n\nThe `certificate.pem` file that is generated can be used with **grocer**.\n\n### Alternative way to generate certificate file (no Mac OS X required)\n\nGenerate private key and unsigned certificate:\n\n```bash\n openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout push_private_key.pem -out push.csr\n```\n\n* Go to Apple Developer site and select [Add iOS Certificate](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/certificate/certificateCreate.action).\n* Choose *Apple Push Notification service SSL (Sandbox & Production)*.\n* Upload the `push.csr` file during the *Generate your certificate* step.\n* Download `aps.cer` on the next step.\n\nCreate `push.pem` file from `aps.cer` with following command:\n\n```bash\nopenssl x509 -in aps.cer -inform der -out push.pem\n```\n\nMerge `push.pem` file and your private key into `certificate.pem`:\n\n```bash\ncat push.pem push_private_key.pem > certificate.pem\n```\n\n## Support Channels\n\n[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/grocer/grocer/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/grocer/grocer/pulls) are the primary venues for communicating issues and discussing possible features.\nSeveral of us also regularly hang out in the `#grocer` channel on Freenode; feel free to pop in and ask questions there as well.\nThanks! :heart:\n"

  "readme_contents": "# MPParallaxView\n\nApple TV Parallax effect in Swift. Rotate view using touch or accelerometer.\n\n![Preview](Resources/demo.gif)\n\n## Usage\n\nTo run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.\n\nWant to quickly look at demo? Type `pod try MPParallaxView`!\n\n## Parallax effect\n\nYou can easily customize Parallax View in Storyboard! Jump into Example project to look at properties.\n\nHow about accelerometer parallax instead of touch? Set **Accelerometer Enabled** to **On** in Storyboard.\n\nThere are 3 different ways to set up parallax:\n* **.basedOnHierarchyInParallaxView** - views in background moves less than views in foreground. You can increase the movement by changing multiplerOfIndexInHierarchyToParallaxOffset - this value will be multiplied by index of view in hierarchy. Default.\n* **.basedOnTag** - set a tag for a view. For instance, snowflakes image view has 13 tag which means noticeable movement. On the other hand, top view with cast members has 1 tag - almost no movement.\n* **.custom(Int)** - provide your custom value.\n\n## Requirements\n\nXcode 8, iOS 9\n\n## Installation\n\nMPParallaxView is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install\nit, simply add the following line to your Podfile:\n\n```ruby\npod \"MPParallaxView\"\n```\n\n## Author\n\nMichal Pyrka  \nTwitter: [mikep_3](https://twitter.com/mike_p3)\n\n## Other\n\nCheck out the article about this repo: [Apple TV Parallax Effect in Swift](http://www.thedroidsonroids.com/blog/ios/apple-tv-parallax-effect-in-swift/)\n\n[Inspired by Designmodo](http://designmodo.com/apple-tv-effect)  \nThanks [Konstantine Trundayev\n](https://dribbble.com/k0t) for Interstellar assets!\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2015 - 2017 Droids On Roids LLC\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

  "readme_contents": "# eduVPN iOS and macOS apps\n\nThese apps depend on [TunnelKit](https://github.com/keeshux/tunnelkit).\n\nThe app contains a [Network Tunneling Protocol Client](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension) and allows its users to create a VPN tunnel if you are able to connect to an eduVPN or Let's Connect enabled server.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2021 The Commons Conservancy. All rights reserved.\n\n### Part I\n\nThis project is licensed under the [GPLv3][license-content].\n\n### Part II\n\nAs seen in [libsignal-protocol-c][license-signal]:\n\n> Additional Permissions For Submission to Apple App Store: Provided that you are otherwise in compliance with the GPLv3 for each covered work you convey (including without limitation making the Corresponding Source available in compliance with Section 6 of the GPLv3), the Author also grants you the additional permission to convey through the Apple App Store non-source executable versions of the Program as incorporated into each applicable covered work as Executable Versions only under the Mozilla Public License version 2.0 (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/).\n\n\n## Beware\n\nDue to the usage of Network Extensions, you can not fully test this app on a Simulator.\n\n> The infrastructure for Network Extension (NE) providers is simply not present on the simulator because, conceptually, it lives \u2018below\u2019 the kernel, and the simulator is layered on the OS X kernel.\n\n[More info here.](https://forums.developer.apple.com/message/134358#134358)\n\n## Versioning\n\nThe build proces takes the number of commits on the current branch as the build number with `git rev-list HEAD --count`. The version string is configured in [AppVersion.xcconfig](EduVPN/Config/AppVersion.xcconfig).\n\nThe exact behavior is defined in the script [set_build_number.sh](Scripts/set_build_number.sh).\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### CocoaPods\n\nMost dependencies are managed with CocoaPods. But this repository is set up in such a way that you do not need CocoaPods to build this project, only when updating dependencies.\nDependencies are defined in a [Podfile](https://github.com/eduvpn/ios/blob/master/Podfile), exact versions are 'locked' in [Podfile.lock](https://github.com/eduvpn/ios/blob/master/Podfile.lock). All dependencies defined in the Podfile are committed to this repository.\n\n### Swift Package Manager\n\nWireGuardKit alone is managed with Swift Package Manager, tied to either a specific version or commit.\n\n## Building\n\nThere are two flavours of apps that are built from the same codebase:\n\n  - [eduVPN](https://www.eduvpn.org) app\n  - [Let\u2019s Connect!](https://www.letsconnect-vpn.org) app\n\nThis needs to be configured in two files, which are different for macOS\nand iOS:\n\n  - For macOS:\n      - `Config/Mac/config.json`\n      - `Config/Mac/Developer-macOS.xcconfig`\n  - For iOS:\n      - `Config/iOS/config.json`\n      - `Config/iOS/Developer.xcconfig`\n\n### Pre-requisites\n\n 1. SwiftLint and Go need to be installed. The build setup looks for these in the paths that HomeBrew installs into.\n\n    To install, run:\n    ~~~\n    brew install swiftlint go\n    ~~~\n\n    Go version 1.16 is required.\n\n 2. An explicit App ID needs to be created at the Apple Developer website for each platform\n\n    To do this, you can:\n\n     1. Go to your [Apple Developer account page](https://developer.apple.com/account/)\n     2. Go to Certificates, IDs and Profiles > Identifiers\n     3. Create an _App ID_ with an _Explicit_ _Bundle ID_, with the following _Capabilities_:\n          - App Groups\n          - Network Extensions\n     4. Specify the _Bundle ID_ in the appropriate `Developer*.xcconfig` file as described below\n\n### Building the eduVPN macOS app\n\nTo build the app, run:\n```\n$ cp Config/Mac/config-eduvpn_new_discovery.json Config/Mac/config.json\n$ cp Config/Mac/privacy_statement-eduvpn.json Config/Mac/privacy_statement.json\n$ cp Config/Mac/Developer-macOS.xcconfig.eduvpn-template Config/Mac/Developer-macOS.xcconfig\n$ vim Config/Mac/Developer-macOS.xcconfig # Edit as reqd.\n```\n\nThen, open `EduVPN.xcworkspace` in Xcode and build the 'EduVPN-macOS' target.\n\n### Building the Let\u2019s Connect! macOS app\n\nTo build the app, run:\n```\n$ cp Config/Mac/config-letsconnect_new_discovery.json Config/Mac/config.json\n$ cp Config/Mac/privacy_statement-letsconnect.json Config/Mac/privacy_statement.json\n$ cp Config/Mac/Developer-macOS.xcconfig.letsconnect-template Config/Mac/Developer-macOS.xcconfig\n$ vim Config/Mac/Developer-macOS.xcconfig # Edit as reqd.\n```\n\nThen, open `EduVPN.xcworkspace` in Xcode and build the 'EduVPN-macOS' target.\n\n### Building the eduVPN iOS app\n\nTo build the app, run:\n```\n$ cp Config/iOS/config-eduvpn_new_discovery.json Config/iOS/config.json\n$ cp Config/iOS/privacy_statement-eduvpn.json Config/iOS/privacy_statement.json\n$ cp Config/iOS/Developer.xcconfig.eduvpn-template Config/iOS/Developer.xcconfig\n$ vim Config/iOS/Developer.xcconfig # Edit as reqd.\n```\n\nThen, open `EduVPN.xcworkspace` in Xcode and build the 'EduVPN-iOS' target.\n\n### Building the Let\u2019s Connect! iOS app\n\nTo build the app, run:\n```\n$ cp Config/iOS/config-letsconnect_new_discovery.json Config/iOS/config.json\n$ cp Config/iOS/privacy_statement-letsconnect.json Config/iOS/privacy_statement.json\n$ cp Config/iOS/Developer.xcconfig.letsconnect-template Config/iOS/Developer.xcconfig\n$ vim Config/iOS/Developer.xcconfig # Edit as reqd.\n```\n\nThen, open `EduVPN.xcworkspace` in Xcode and build the 'EduVPN-iOS' target.\n\n## Testing\n\nThe app can be tested using UI tests written using XCUITest.\n\nThe tests can modify the app data, so to avoid losing your added\nservers, it's recommended that you use a separate app bundle identifier\nfor running the UI tests. The app bundle identifier is configurable in\nDeveloper.xcconfig or Developer-macOS.xcconfig as specified above.\n\n### Testing the eduVPN iOS app\n\nThe iOS UI tests are intended to be run on a physical device (not on the\niOS Simulator).\n\nBefore running the tests, specify the server credentials:\n\n```\n$ cp EduVPN-UITests-iOS/TestServerCredentialsiOS.swift-template EduVPN-UITests-iOS/TestServerCredentialsiOS.swift\n$ vim EduVPN-UITests-iOS/TestServerCredentialsiOS.swift # Enter credentials\n```\n\nThen:\n 1. Open `EduVPN.xcworkspace` in Xcode\n 2. Ensure the test targets (EduVPN-Tests-iOS, EduVPN-UITests-iOS) have\n    correct 'Team' set under 'Signing & Capabilities'\n 3. In the scheme selector breadcrumb panel, select the 'EduVPN-iOS'\n    scheme and your connected iDevice\n 4. Click on Product > Test\n\nDo not use the iDevice when the test is running.\n\n### Testing the eduVPN macOS app\n\nBefore running the tests, specify the server credentials:\n\n```\n$ cp EduVPN-UITests-macOS/TestServerCredentialsmacOS.swift-template EduVPN-UITests-macOS/TestServerCredentialsmacOS.swift\n$ vim EduVPN-UITests-macOS/TestServerCredentialsmacOS.swift # Enter credentials\n```\n\nThen:\n 1. Open Safari.app, open a new private window, close all other windows\n 2. Open `EduVPN.xcworkspace` in Xcode\n 3. Ensure the test targets (EduVPN-Tests-macOS, EduVPN-UITests-macOS) have\n    correct 'Team' set under 'Signing & Capabilities'\n 4. In the scheme selector breadcrumb panel, select the 'EduVPN-iOS'\n    scheme and the macOS machine\n 5. Click on Product > Test\n\nDo not use the macOS machine when the test is running.\n"

  "readme_contents": "A handful of quartz filters for saving PDFs.\n\nWith all due respect to Jerome Colas:\n\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/1292868?start=0&tstart=0\n\nhttps://public.me.com/jcolas\n\nThe following text is his:\n\nIt uses the poorly documented Quartz filtering ability for PDFs in Preview. There are a couple of articles I found here or elsewhere on the web, but they still don't make things simple.\n\nYou can manually edit those same settings (using Colorsync Utility) but can also benefit from my trial-and-error process and directly download from my iDisk.\nAfter download and decompressions, *simply drag the downloaded \"Filters\" folder to /Library/PDF Services* - And if you already have such a folder, simply copy the contents of the downloaded folder into it.\n\nFeel free to use, download, copy, use the idea ... in any way you like.\n\n*Then, in order to create a compressed PDF with decent quality :*\n\n- Open your existing PDF in preview, or Print any document using \"Open PDF in Preview\" from the PDF pop-up menu in the Print dialog\n- Choose Save As in the File Menu (pretty easy I guess), then choose PDF as format, and one of the \"Reduce to XXX dpi ...\" Quartz filters, and click Save.\n\nI included 8 settings which produce increasingly large files, with increasingly better quality. I find the 150 dpi / average JPEG compression to be quite suitable for most purposes. I have tried (before Leopard) PDF compression software like PDFshrink but was not satisifed with the results and interface.\n\nThese filters produce much better (better being in terms of consistency, file size and quality) than the filter Apple includes with Leopard (and maybe Tiger ?).\nThe Apple \"Reduce file size filter\" scales images by 50%, with target dimensions between 128 and 512 pixels, which can give very unusable results.\n\nThe filters I use 2 two things:\n\n- resample images to 75, 150, 300 or 600 dpi (I do not not if there is upsampling)\n- compress the images using Jpeg compression at average or low quality\n\nOnce installed, you can visualize, edit or copy them using Colorsync Utility (in the Applications/ Utilities folder)\n\nAs an example, using a 73 MB PDF from a 55 page Powerpoint presentation, the compressed files have the following sizes:\n\n- 75 dpi low quality : 2.7 MB\n- 75 dpi average quality : 3.2 MB\n- 150 dpi low quality : 4.2 MB\n- 150 dpi average quality : 5.3 MB\n- 300 dpi low quality : 7.6 MB\n- 300 dpi average quality : 10.2 MB\n- 600 dpi low quality : 16.0 MB\n- 600 dpi average quality : 20.3 MB\n\n## Note:\nIn Lion, the `*.qfilter` files should be copied to the following location: `/Library/Filters`\n\nThe filters will **not** show up in Preview if the files are copied to the user's folder `~/Library/Filters`\n\nAlternatively, in Mountain Lion, since there is no `/Library/Filters` folder by default, you can put them in `/Library/PDF Services`\n"

Iterate over nested, or multidimensional, hashes.\n\n\n## The Holiday Suppliers\n\n### Instructions\n\nYou have a bunch of decorations for various holidays organized by season.\n\n```ruby\nholiday_supplies = {\n  :winter => {\n    :christmas => [\"Lights\", \"Wreath\"],\n    :new_years => [\"Party Hats\"]\n  },\n  :summer => {\n    :fourth_of_july => [\"Fireworks\", \"BBQ\"]\n  },\n  :fall => {\n    :thanksgiving => [\"Turkey\"]\n  },\n  :spring => {\n    :memorial_day => [\"BBQ\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWrite your methods in `lib/holiday.rb`; use the comments in each method as guides.\n\n* Write a method that returns the second supply for the Fourth of July. For eg:\n\n```ruby\ndef second_supply_for_fourth_of_july(holiday_supplies)\n  holiday_supplies[:summer][:fourth_of_july][1]\nend\n```\n\n* Write a method that adds a supply to both Winter holidays.\n\n* Write a method that adds a supply to Memorial Day.\n\n* Write a method that adds a new holiday and its associated supplies to any season.\n\n* Write a method to collect all Winter supplies from all the winter holidays. For eg:\n\n```bash\nwinter_supplies(holiday_supplies) #=> [\"Lights\", \"Wreath\", etc]\n```\n\n* Write a method that uses a loop to list out all the supplies you have for each holiday and the season. Use string manipulation to get your output to match what the test is expecting.\n\n* Here are a few helpful tips:\n  * Our hash keys are symbols. We need to convert them into strings. Use the `.to_s` method on a symbol to convert it into a string.\n  * Look closely at the output string that the test is expecting. You'll notice that it expects holiday names, like \"New Years\", to have both words capitalized. Ruby has a `.capitalize` method that you can call on a string. **But, note:**\n    * `.capitalize` returns the capitalized string but *doesn't change* the original string. So, when you call on that same string in the future, it *isn't capitalized!* You can capitalize a string for now and evermore by using the bang operator (`!`).\n    * You'll need to capitalize *both words* in a given holiday's name. If you call `\"new years\".capitalize!`, it will return `\"New years\"`. In order to capitalize *both* words, you'll need to `.split` the string into an array and iterate over that array to `.capitalize!` each word in it. Then, you'll need to `.join` the array back into a string.\n    * If you're unfamiliar with the methods mentioned above, look them up in the Ruby documentation.\n\nExample of expected output:\n\n```\nWinter:\n  Christmas: Lights, Wreath\n  New Years: Party Hats\n```\n\n* Write a method to collect all holidays with \"BBQ\" in the supply array. The method should behave as seen below:\n\n```bash\nholidays_with_bbqs(holiday_supplies)\n#=> [:fourth_of_july, :memorial_day]\n```\n\n**Reminder:** This is a challenging lab, so remember to use Pry, Google, and the Flatiron School community to help you get the tests passing.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [StackOverflow: Accessing Elements of Nested Hashes in Ruby](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5544858/accessing-elements-of-nested-hashes-in-ruby)\n- [honeybadger - Advanced Ruby Hash Techniques](http://blog.honeybadger.io/advanced-ruby-hash-techniques/)\n\n\n\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Placing Virtual Objects in Augmented Reality\n\nLearn best practices for visual feedback, gesture interactions, and realistic rendering in AR experiences, as well as tips for building SceneKit-based AR apps.\n\n## Overview\n\nAugmented reality offers new ways for users to interact with real and virtual 3D content in your app. However, many of the fundamental principles of human interface design are still valid. Convincing AR illusions also require careful attention to 3D asset design and rendering. By following this article's guidelines for AR human interface principles and experimenting with this example code, you can create immersive, intuitive augmented reality experiences.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nARKit is available on any iOS 11 device, but the world tracking features that enable high-quality AR experiences require a device with the A9 or later processor.\n\n## Feedback\n\n**Help users recognize when your app is ready for real-world interactions.**\nTracking the real-world environment involves complex algorithms whose timeliness and accuracy are affected by real-world conditions.\n\nThe `FocusSquare` class in this example project draws a square outline in the AR view, giving the user hints about the status of ARKit world tracking. The square changes size to reflect estimated scene depth, and switches between open and closed states with a \"lock\" animation to indicate whether ARKit has detected a plane suitable for placing an object.\n\nUse the [`session(_:cameraDidChangeTrackingState:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arsessionobserver/2887450-session) delegate method to detect changes in tracking quality, and present feedback to the user when low-quality conditions are correctable (for example, by telling the user to move to an environment with better lighting).\n\nUse specific terms a user is likely to recognize. For example, if you give textual feedback for plane detection, a user not familiar with technical definitions might mistake the word \"plane\" as referring to aircraft.\n\nFall back gracefully if tracking fails, and allow the user to reset tracking if their experience isn't working as expected. See the `restartExperience` button and method in this example's `ViewController` class. The `use3DOFTrackingFallback` variable controls whether to switch to a lower-fidelity session configuration when tracking quality is poor.\n\n**Help users understand the relationship of your app's virtual content to the real world.** Use visual cues in your UI that react to changes in camera position relative to virtual content.\n\nThe focus square disappears after the user places an object in the scene, and reappears when the user points the camera away from the object.\n\nThe `Plane` class in this example handles visualization of real-world planes detected by ARKit. Its `createOcclusionNode` and `updateOcclusionNode` methods create invisible geometry that realistically obscures virtual content.\n\n## Direct Manipulation\n\n**Provide common gestures, familiar to users of other iOS apps, for interacting with real-world objects.** See the `Gesture` class in this example for implementations of the gestures available in this example app, such as one-finger dragging to move a virtual object and two-finger rotation to spin the object.\n\nMap touch gestures into a restricted space so the user can more easily control results. Touch gestures are inherently two-dimensional, but an AR experience involves the three dimensions of the real world. For example:\n\n- Limit object dragging to the two-dimensional plane the object rests on. (Especially if a plane represents the ground or floor, it often makes sense to ignore the plane's extent while dragging.)\n\n- Limit object rotation to a single axis at a time. (In this example, each object rests on a plane, so the object can rotate around a vertical axis.)\n\n- Don't allow the user to resize virtual objects, or offer this ability only sparingly. A virtual object inhabits the real world more convincingly when it has an intuitive intrinsic size. Additionally, a user may become confused as to whether they're resizing an object or changing its depth relative to the camera. (If you do provide object resizing, use pinch gestures.)\n\nWhile the user is dragging a virtual object, smooth the changes in its position so that it doesn't appear to jump while moving. See the `updateVirtualObjectPosition` method in this example's `ViewController` class for an example of smoothing based on perceived distance from the camera.\n\nSet thresholds for gestures so that the user doesn't trigger a gesture accidentally, but moderate your thresholds so that gestures aren't too hard to discover or intentionally trigger. See the `TwoFingerGesture` class for examples of using thresholds to dynamically choose gesture effects.\n\nProvide a large enough area where the user can tap (or begin a drag) on a virtual object, so that they can still see the object while moving it. See how the `firstTouchWasOnObject` boolean is computed in the `TwoFingerGesture` class for examples.\n\n**Design interactions for situations where AR illusions can be most convincing.** For example, place virtual content near the centers of detected planes, where it's safer to assume that the detected plane is a good match to the real-world surface. It may be tempting to design experiences that use the full surface of a table top, where virtual scene elements can react to or fall off the table's edges. However, world tracking and plane detection may not precisely estimate the edges of the table.\n\n\n## User Control\n\n**Strive for a balance between accurately placing virtual content and respecting the user's input.** For example, consider a situation where the user attempts to place content that should appear on top of a flat surface.\n\n- First, try to place content by using the [`hitTest(_:types:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arframe/2875718-hittest) method to search for an intersection with a plane anchor. If you don't find a plane anchor, there might still be a plane at the target location that has not yet been identified by plane detection.\n- Lacking a plane anchor, you can hit-test against scene features to get a rough estimate for where to place content right away, and refine that estimate over time as ARKit detects planes.\n- When plane detection provides a better estimate for where to place content, use animation to subtly move that content to its new position. Having user-placed content suddenly jump to a new position can break the AR illusion and confuse the user.\n- Filter out hit test results which are too close or too far away. In most scenarios there exists a reasonable limit for how far away virtual content can be placed. To prevent users from accidentally placing virtual content too far away you can make use of the `distance` property of `ARHitTestResult` to filter out hit tests which exeed the limit.\n\n**Avoid interrupting the AR experience.** If the user transitions to another fullscreen UI in your app, the AR view might not be an expected state when coming back.\n\nUse the popover presentation (even on iPhone) for auxiliary view controllers to keep the user in the AR experience while adjusting settings or making a modal selection. In this example, the `SettingsViewController` and `VirtualObjectSelectionViewController` classes use popover presentation.\n\n## Testing\n\nFor testing and debugging AR experiences, it helps to have a live visualization of the scene processing that ARKit performs. See the `showDebugVisuals` method in this project's `ViewController` class for world tracking visualization, and the `HitTestVisualization` class for a demonstration of ARKit's feature detection methods.\n"

The apps (for both iOS and Android) use Bluetooth technology to exchange anonymous encrypted data with other mobile phones (on which the app is also installed) in the vicinity of an app user's phone. The data is stored locally on each user's device, preventing authorities or other parties from accessing or controlling the data. This repository contains the **native iOS implementation** of the Corona-Warn-App.\n**Visit our [FAQ page](https://www.coronawarn.app/en/faq/) for more information and common issues.**\n\n## Development\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Install Xcode 13.0\n2. Open [ENA.xcworkspace](./src/xcode/ENA.xcworkspace)\n3. Select the right app scheme.\n\n   We added the schema `ENACommunity` to our project which should enable third party developers to run and test the code. This schema uses a mocked implementation of `ExposureManager` in `SceneDelegate` and injects it into the application.\n\n4. Set the user-defined variable to your development team\n\n   In the [project.pbxproj](./src/xcode/ENA/ENA.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj) file, set IPHONE_APP_DEV_TEAM for the build setting `Community` to your development team\n5. Install SwiftLint\n\n   ```console\n   brew install swiftlint\n   ```\n\n6. (Optional) Set up fastlane:\n   Make sure you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:\n\n   ```console\n   xcode-select --install\n   ```\n   Install _fastlane_ using [Bundler](https://bundler.io/)\n   ```console\n   cd src/xcode && bundle install --path vendor/bundle\n   ```\n\n7. (Optional) Add code snippet to Xcode:\n   CodeSnipets are located inside the folder 'CodeSnippets'.\n   Copy MARKs.codesnippet  to Xcode UserData folder:\n   ```console\n   cp CodeSnippets/MARKs.codesnippet ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/\n   ```\n\n### Build\n\nAfter setting up your environment as stated in [Setup](#Setup), you should be able to build the app using the scheme `ENACommunity`.\n\nIf you want to use fastlane instead, you can do so by running the following commands:\n\n```console\ncd src/xcode && bundle exec fastlane build_community\ncd src/xcode && bundle exec fastlane test\n```\n\n## Architecture & Documentation\n\nThe full documentation for the Corona-Warn-App is in the [cwa-documentation](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation) repository. The documentation repository contains technical documents, architecture information, UI/UX specifications, and whitepapers related to this implementation.\n\nAutomatically generated documentation of the source code can be found at [GitHub Pages](https://corona-warn-app.github.io/cwa-app-ios/index.html)\n\n## Support & Feedback\n\nThe following channels are available for discussions, feedback, and support requests:\n\n| Type                     | Channel                                                |\n| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **General Discussion**   | <a href=\"https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation/issues/new/choose\" title=\"General Discussion\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/github/issues/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation/question.svg?style=flat-square\"></a> </a>   |\n| **Feature Requests**    | <a href=\"https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-wishlist/issues/new/choose\" title=\"Create Feature Request\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/github/issues/corona-warn-app/cwa-wishlist?style=flat-square\"></a>  |\n| **Concept Feedback**    | <a href=\"https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation/issues/new/choose\" title=\"Open Concept Feedback\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/github/issues/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation/architecture.svg?style=flat-square\"></a>  |\n| **iOS App Issue**    | <a href=\"https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-ios/issues/new/choose\" title=\"Open iOS Suggestion\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/github/issues/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-ios?style=flat-square\"></a>  |\n| **Backend Issue**    | <a href=\"https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-server/issues/new/choose\" title=\"Open Backend Issue\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/github/issues/corona-warn-app/cwa-server?style=flat-square\"></a>  |\n| **Other Requests**    | <a href=\"mailto:corona-warn-app.opensource@sap.com\" title=\"Email CWA Team\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/email-CWA%20team-green?logo=mail.ru&style=flat-square&logoColor=white\"></a>   |\n\n## Data privacy\n\nFor the possibility to read and export the log files which are created and filled at using the app, we ensure respecting the data privacy by censoring private information (e.g. names of people in the contact journal). To ensure an efficient bug fixing on the side of the developers and testers, the corresponding information is still logged but marked as private. This affects that in release builds for the general public, the logged information is replaced by '\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude49\ud83d\ude4a'. It may appear an additional text which explains what information is censored at this point.\n\n## How to Contribute\n\nContribution and feedback are encouraged and always welcome. For more information about how to contribute, the project structure, as well as additional contribution information, see our [Contribution Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) at all times.\n\n#### SwiftLint\n\nThis project uses [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to ensure a unified code style. The linter is run on every build and shows all warnings and error within Xcode's Issue Navigator.\n\nPlease ensure you have installed SwiftLint when working on this project and fix any warnings or error before committing your changes.\n\nUse `brew install swiftlint` to install SwiftLint or download it manually from https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint. When not installed a warning will be triggered during build.\n\n## Contributors\n\nThe German government has asked SAP and Deutsche Telekom to develop the Corona-Warn-App for Germany as open source software. Deutsche Telekom is providing the network and mobile technology and will operate and run the backend for the app in a safe, scalable and stable manner. SAP is responsible for the app development, its framework and the underlying platform. Therefore, development teams of SAP and Deutsche Telekom are contributing to this project. At the same time our commitment to open source means that we are enabling -in fact encouraging- all interested parties to contribute and become part of its developer community.\n\n## Repositories\n\nA list of all public repositories from the Corona-Warn-App can be found [here](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation/blob/master/README.md#repositories).\n\n## Licensing\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2022 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.\n\nLicensed under the **Apache License, Version 2.0** (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n\nYou may obtain a copy of the License from [here](./LICENSE).\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.

  "language": "Swift",
  "readme_contents": "SMCKit\n======\n\nAn Apple System Management Controller (SMC) library & command line tool in Swift\nfor Intel based Macs. The library works by talking to the AppleSMC.kext (kernel\nextension), the private driver for the SMC. Read temperature sensors, get and\nset fan speed (RPM), and more.\n\n- For an example usage of this library, see\n  [dshb](https://github.com/beltex/dshb), a macOS system monitor in Swift\n- For other system related statistics in Swift for macOS, see\n  [SystemKit](https://github.com/beltex/SystemKit)\n\n\n### System Management Controller\n\n_\"The System Management Controller (SMC) is an internal subsystem introduced by\nApple Inc. with the introduction of their new Intel processor based machines\nin 2006. It takes over the functions of the SMU. The SMC manages thermal and\npower conditions to optimize the power and airflow while keeping audible noise\nto a minimum. Power consumption and temperature are monitored by the operating\nsystem, which communicates the necessary adjustments back to the SMC. The SMC\nmakes the changes, slowing down or speeding up fans as necessary.\"_\n-via Wikipedia\n\nFor more see:\n\n- [System Management Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Controller)\n- [System Management Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Unit)\n- [Power Management Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Management_Unit)\n\n\n### Requirements\n\n- [Xcode 9.0 (Swift 4.0)](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/)\n- macOS 10.12 Sierra and above **for development** (due to Xcode)\n- OS X 10.9 Mavericks and above **for use** (due to Swift)\n\n\n### Clone\n\nMake sure to use the recursive option on clone to initialize all submodules.\n\n```sh\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/beltex/SMCKit\n```\n\nIncase you have already cloned the repository, run the following inside the\nproject directory.\n\n```sh\ngit submodule update --init\n```\n\n\n### SMCKitTool\n\nA macOS command line tool for interfacing with the SMC using SMCKit. The\n[CommandLine](https://github.com/jatoben/CommandLine) library is used for\nthe CLI and [ronn](https://github.com/rtomayko/ronn) for generating the\n[manual page](https://beltex.github.io/SMCKit).\n\n##### Install\n\nThis will build SMCKitTool (`smckit(1)`) from source and place the binary and\nmanual page in your path.\n\n```\nmake install\n```\n\n##### Example\n\n```sh\n$ smckit\n-- Temperature --\nAMBIENT_AIR_0           34.0\u00b0C\nCPU_0_DIE               48.0\u00b0C\nCPU_0_PROXIMITY         39.0\u00b0C\nENCLOSURE_BASE_0        29.0\u00b0C\nENCLOSURE_BASE_1        29.0\u00b0C\nENCLOSURE_BASE_2        28.0\u00b0C\nHEATSINK_1              34.0\u00b0C\nMEM_SLOTS_PROXIMITY     36.0\u00b0C\nPALM_REST               27.0\u00b0C\n-- Fan --\n[id 0] Right Side\n    Min:      1299 RPM\n    Max:      6199 RPM\n    Current:  1292 RPM\n-- Power --\nAC Present:       true\nBattery Powered:  false\nCharging:         false\nBattery Ok:       true\nBattery Count:    1\n-- Misc --\nDisc in ODD:      false\n```\n\n\n### Library Usage Notes\n\n- The use of this library  will almost certainly not be allowed in the\n  Mac App Store as it is essentially using a private API\n- If you are creating a macOS command line tool, you cannot use SMCKit as a\n  library as Swift does not currently support static libraries. In such a\n  case, the `SMC.swift` file must simply be included in your project as another\n  source file. See\n  [SwiftInFlux/Runtime Dynamic Libraries](https://github.com/ksm/SwiftInFlux#runtime-dynamic-libraries)\n  for more information and both SMCKitTool &\n  [dshb](https://github.com/beltex/dshb) as examples of such a case.\n\n\n### References\n\nThere are many projects that interface with the SMC for one purpose or another.\nCredit is most certainly due to them for the reference. Such projects as:\n\n- iStat Pro\n- [osx-cpu-temp](https://github.com/lavoiesl/osx-cpu-temp)\n- [PowerManagement](http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/PowerManagement/)\n- [powermetrics(1)](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/powermetrics.1.html)\n- [smcFanControl](https://github.com/hholtmann/smcFanControl)\n\nHandy I/O Kit references:\n\n- [iOS Hacker's Handbook](http://ca.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118204123.html)\n- [Mac OS X and iOS Internals: To the Apple's Core](http://ca.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118057651.html)\n- [OS X and iOS Kernel Programming](http://www.apress.com/apple-mac/objective-c/9781430235361)\n\n\n### License\n\nThis project is under the **MIT License**.\n\n\n### Fun\n\nWhile the SMC driver is closed source, the call strucutre and definition of\ncertain structs needed to interact with it (see `SMCParamStruct`) happened to\nappear in the open source Apple **PowerManagement** project at around version\n211, and soon after disappeared. They can be seen in the\n[PrivateLib.c](http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/PowerManagement/PowerManagement-211/pmconfigd/PrivateLib.c)\nfile under `pmconfigd`. In the very same source file, the following snippet can be\nfound:\n\n```c\n// And simply AppleSMC with kCFBooleanTrue to let them know time is changed.\n// We don't pass any information down.\nIORegistryEntrySetCFProperty( _smc,\n                    CFSTR(\"TheTimesAreAChangin\"),\n                    kCFBooleanTrue);\n```\n\nAlmost certainly a reference to Bob Dylan's\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_They_Are_a-Changin%27_(song)\">The Times They Are a-Changin'</a> :)\n"

It offers functionality to easily convert data between worlds, e.g. recalculating timestamps from unix epoch to apple epoch and vice versa. A feature to automagically create (guess) the plist structure from a normal PHP data structure will help you dump your data to plist in no time.\n\nCFPropertyList does not rely on any \"Apple proprietary\" components, like plutil. CFPropertyList runs on any Operating System with PHP and some standard extensions installed.\n\nAlthough you might want to deliver data to your iPhone application, you might want to run those server side services on your standard Linux (or even Windows) environment, rather than buying an expensive Apple Server. With CFPropertyList you now have the power to provide data from your favorite Operating System.\n\n## Build Status\n\n|**Release channel**|Beta Channel|\n|:---:|:---:|\n|![unit tests](https://github.com/TECLIB/CFPropertyList/actions/workflows/run_tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)|![unit tests](https://github.com/TECLIB/CFPropertyList/actions/workflows/run_tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=develop)|\n\n## Installation\n\nSee or [How to install article](https://teclib.github.io/CFPropertyList/howtos/installation).\n\n## Documentation\n\nWe maintain a detailed documentation of the project on the Website, check the Development [Development](https://teclib.github.io/CFPropertyList/) and [How-tos](https://teclib.github.io/CFPropertyList/howtos) sections.\n\n## Versioning\n\nIn order to provide transparency on our release cycle and to maintain backward compatibility, Flyve MDM is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/).

  "readme_contents": "# ESP Apple HomeKit ADK\n\n[HomeKit](https://developer.apple.com/homekit/) is a framework developed by Apple for communicating with and controlling connected accessories in a user\u2019s home using iOS devices. This project is a port of Apple's Open Source [HomeKit ADK](https://github.com/apple/HomeKitADK) for ESP32 and ESP32S2. This can be used by any developer to prototype non-commercial smart home accessories.\n\nYou can also check out the **ESP HomeKit SDK** [here](https://github.com/espressif/esp-homekit-sdk) which is Espressif's implementation of the HomeKit Specifications.\n\n> Note: If you want to use HomeKit for commercial purposes, please check [here](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/sdks/esp-homekit-sdk).\n\n## Get Started\n\n### Set up Host environment\n\nSet up the host environment and ESP IDF (**master** branch) as per the steps given [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html). The commit that was used for testing is: [012b111](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/012b111d6d46812a768838c87417f5e3754bc90e)\n\n### Set up MbedTLS\n\nESP-IDF currently uses MbedTLS 2.16.x, whereas HomeKit ADK requires 2.18. A branch mbedtls-2.16.6-adk is being maintained [here](https://github.com/espressif/mbedtls/tree/mbedtls-2.16.6-adk) which has the required patches from 2.18, on top of 2.16.6. To switch to this, follow these steps:\n\n```text\n$ cd $IDF_PATH/components/mbedtls/mbedtls\n$ git pull\n$ git checkout -b mbedtls-2.16.6-adk origin/mbedtls-2.16.6-adk\n```\n\n### Get esp-apple-homekit-adk\n\nPlease clone this repository using the below command:\n\n```text\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-apple-homekit-adk.git\n```\n\n> Note the --recursive option. This is required to pull in the HomeKit ADK repository into esp-apple-homekit-adk. In case you have already cloned the repository without this option, execute this to the pull in the submodule:\n> `git submodule update --init --recursive`\n\n\n### Compile and Flash\n\nYou can use esp-apple-homekit-adk with any ESP32 or ESP32-S2 board. We have provided a Lightbulb example for reference. Compile and flash as below:\n\n```text\n$ cd /path/to/esp-apple-homekit-adk/examples/Lightbulb\n$ export ESPPORT=/dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART #Set your board's serial port here\n$ idf.py set-target <esp32/esp32s2>\n$ idf.py menuconfig # Set Example Configuration -> WiFi SSID/Password\n$ idf.py flash\n$ esptool.py -p $ESPPORT write_flash 0x340000 accessory_setup.bin\n$ idf.py monitor\n```\n\nAs the device boots up and connects to your Home Wi-Fi network (configured using the menuconfig), you will see some logs like these:\n\n```text\nI (2788) wifi station: connected to ap SSID:myssid password:mypassword\n1970-01-01'T'00:00:02'Z'\tDefault\t[com.apple.mfi.HomeKit.Core:AccessoryServer] Version information:\nlibhap: Unknown\n  - Version: Internal (May 12 2020 02:42:49) - compatibility version 7\nUsing platform: ESP32\n  - Version: v4.2-dev-1485-g1ad1791df7-dirty (May 12 2020 02:42:38) - compatibility version 7\n  - Available features:\n    - Key-Value store\n    - Accessory setup manager\n    - Service discovery\n1970-01-01'T'00:00:02'Z'\tDefault\t[com.apple.mfi.HomeKit.Platform:Clock] Using 'gettimeofday'.\n```\n\n### Add acccessory in the Home app\n\nOpen the Home app on your iPhone/iPad and follow these steps\n\n- Tap on \"Add Accessory\".\n- Choose the \"I Don't Have a Code or Cannot Scan\" option.\n- Tap on \"Acme Light Bulb\" in the list of Nearby Accessories.\n- Select the \"Add Anyway\" option for the \"Uncertified Accessory\" prompt.\n- Enter 11122333 as the Setup code.\n- You should eventually see the \"Acme Light Bulb added\" message.\n- Give a custom name, assign to a room, create scenes as required and you are done.\n\n\n### Change the Setup Code\n\nThe setup code of 11122333 was encoded in the accessory_setup.bin image flashed at 0x340000. This was generated using Apple's tools and ESP IDF's nvs partition generator. Steps as follows:\n\n```text\n$ cd /path/to/esp-apple-homekit-adk/homekit_adk\n$ make tools\n$ cd Tools/\n$ ./provision_raspi.sh --category 5 --setup-code 111-22-333 --setup-id ES32 Lightbulb\n```\n\nThis will create the setup info and setup id files as below\n\n```text\n~# tree Lightbulb\nLightbulb\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 40.10\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 40.11\n```\n> Note: Compiling the ADK Tools and using provision_raspi.sh is out of scope of this project. If you face any issues with that, please report directly to Apple on [GitHub](https://github.com/apple/HomeKitADK/issues).\n\n\nNow, generate an nvs image as below:\n\n```text\n$ cd Lightbulb\n$ cp ../../../tools/accessory_setup/accessory_setup.csv .\n$ python $IDF_PATH/components/nvs_flash/nvs_partition_generator/nvs_partition_gen.py generate accessory_setup.csv accessory_setup.bin 0x6000\n```\n\nFlash this using the same command given above.\n\n```text\n$ esptool.py -p $ESPPORT write_flash 0x340000 accessory_setup.bin\n```\n\nIf you want to change the category, setup code or the setup id, change the values while running provision_raspi.sh. The script also generates a QR code that you can directly use for adding the accessory using the Home app.\n\n\n### Resetting HomeKit Pairing\n\nThe accessory pairing information is stored in the NVS (Non Volatile Storage) partition. Once paired, the accessory cannot be paired again, without clearing this pairing information first. It can be done as below:\n\n```text\n$ esptool.py -p $ESPPORT erase_region 0x10000 0x6000\n```\n\n## Resources\n  * Working with HomeKit : [https://developer.apple.com/homekit/](https://developer.apple.com/homekit/)\n  * How to use the Home app : [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204893](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204893)\n  * ESP SoC Resources      : [https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs)\n  * ESP HomeKit SDK (for commercial applications) : [https://www.espressif.com/en/products/sdks/esp-homekit-sdk](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/sdks/esp-homekit-sdk)\n"

When we start downloading, this program takes the download auth token from cookies (as well as other required parameters), and pass them to `aria2`.\n\nAn instance of [Process](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/process) takes the output from `aria2` and shows it on UI. You can achieve the same with `aria2` without this program, but you'd have to manually take out the auth token from cookies and other parameters and feed them into `aria2`.\n\n## Contributions\nAny contribution is more than welcome!

  "readme_contents": "isign\n=====\n\nA tool and library to re-sign iOS applications, without proprietary Apple software.\n\nFor example, an iOS app in development would probably only run on the developer's iPhone. \n``isign`` can alter the app so that it can run on another developer's iPhone.\n\nApple tools already exist to do this. But with ``isign``, now you can do this on operating\nsystems like Linux.\n\n\nTable of contents\n-----------------\n\n- `Installing`_\n- `How to get started`_\n- `How to use isign`_\n- `isign command line arguments`_\n- `Contributing`_\n- `More documentation`_\n- `Authors`_\n\n\n.. _Installing:\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nLinux\n~~~~~\n\nThe latest version of ``isign`` can be installed via `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/isign/>`__:\n\n.. code::\n\n  $ pip install isign\n\nMac OS X\n~~~~~~~~\n\nOn Mac OS X, there are a lot of prerequisites, so the ``pip`` method probably won't work.\nThe easiest method is to use ``git`` to clone the `source code repository <https://github.com/saucelabs/isign>`__ and \nrun the install script:\n\n.. code::\n\n  $ git clone https://github.com/saucelabs/isign.git\n  $ cd isign\n  $ sudo ./INSTALL.sh\n\n.. _How to get started:\n\nHow to get started\n------------------\n\nAll the libraries and tools that ``isign`` needs to run will work on both Linux \nand Mac OS X. However, you will need a Mac to export your Apple developer \ncredentials. \n\nIf you're like most iOS developers, credentials are confusing -- if so check out \nthe `documentation on credentials <https://github.com/saucelabs/isign/blob/master/docs/credentials.rst>`__ on Github.\n\nYou should have a key and certificate in \n`Keychain Access <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain_(software)>`__,\nand a provisioning profile associated with that certificate, that you \ncan use to sign iOS apps for one or more of your own iOS devices.\n\nIn Keychain Access, open the *Certificates*. Find the certificate you use to sign apps. \nRight click on it and export the key as a ``.p12`` file, let's say ``Certificates.p12``. If Keychain \nasks you for a password to protect this file, just leave it blank. \n\nNext, let's extract the key and certificate you need, into a standard PEM format.\n\n.. code::\n\n  $ isign_export_creds.sh ~/Certificates.p12\n\nIf you get prompted for a password, just press ``Return``.\n\nBy default, ``isign_export_creds.sh`` will put these files into ``~/.isign``, which is\nthe standard place to put ``isign`` configuration files.\n\nFinally, you need a provisioning profile from the Apple Developer Portal that uses\nthe same certificate. If you've never dealt with this, the provisioning profile is \nwhat tells the phone that you Apple has okayed you installing apps onto this particular phone.\n\nIf you develop with XCode, you might have a provisioning profile already. \nOn the Mac where you develop with XCode, try running the ``isign_guess_mobileprovision.sh`` script. \nIf you typically have only a few provisioning profiles and install on one phone, it might find it. \n\nAnyway, once you have a ``.mobileprovision`` file, move it to ``~/.isign/isign.mobileprovision``.\n\nThe end result should look like this:\n\n.. code::\n\n  $ ls -l ~/.isign\n  -r--r--r--    1 alice  staff  2377 Sep  4 14:17 certificate.pem\n  -r--r--r--    1 alice  staff  9770 Nov 23 13:30 isign.mobileprovision\n  -r--------    1 alice  staff  1846 Sep  4 14:17 key.pem\n\nAnd now you're ready to start re-signing apps!\n\n.. _How to use isign:\n\nHow to use isign\n----------------\n\nIf you've installed all the files in the proper locations above, then ``isign`` can be now invoked\non any iOS ``.app`` directory, or ``.ipa`` archive, or ``.app.zip`` zipped directory. For example:\n\n.. code::\n\n  $ isign -o resigned.ipa my.ipa\n  archived Ipa to /home/alice/resigned.ipa\n\nYou can also call it from Python:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n  from isign import isign\n\n  isign.resign(\"my.ipa\", output_path=\"resigned.ipa\")\n\n.. _isign command line arguments:\n\nisign command line arguments\n----------------------------\n\n.. code::\n\n  # Resigning by specifying all credentials, input file, and output file\n  $ isign -c /path/to/mycert.pem -k ~/mykey.pem -p path/to/my.mobileprovision \\\n          -o resigned.ipa original.ipa\n\n  # Resigning, with credentials under default filenames in ~/.isign - less to type!\n  $ isign -o resigned.ipa original.ipa\n\n  # Modify Info.plist properties in resigned app\n  $ isign -i CFBundleIdentifier=com.example.myapp,CFBundleName=MyApp -o resigned.ipa original.ipa\n\n  # Display Info.plist properties from an app as JSON\n  $ isign -d my.ipa\n\n  # Get help\n  $ isign -h\n\n**-a <path>, --apple-cert <path>**\n\nPath to Apple certificate in PEM format. This is already included in the library, so you will likely\nnever need it. In the event that the certificates need to be changed, See the `Apple Certificate documentation <docs/applecerts.rst>`__.\n\n**-c <path>, --certificate <path>**\n\nPath to your certificate in PEM format. Defaults to ``$HOME/.isign/certificate.pem``.\n\n**-d, --display**\n\nFor the application path, display the information property list (Info.plist) as JSON.\n\n**-h, --help**\n\nShow a help message and exit.\n\n**-i, --info**\n\nWhile resigning, add or update info in the application's information property list (Info.plist). \nTakes a comma-separated list of key=value pairs, such as \n``CFBundleIdentifier=com.example.app,CFBundleName=ExampleApp``. Use with caution!\nSee Apple documentation for `valid Info.plist keys <https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Introduction/Introduction.html>`_.\n\n**-k <path>, --key <path>**\n\nPath to your private key in PEM format. Defaults to ``$HOME/.isign/key.pem``.\n\n**-n <directory>, --credentials <directory>**\n\nEquivalent to:\n\n.. code::\n\n   -k <directory>/key.pem \n   -c <directory>/certificate.pem \n   -p <directory>/isign.mobileprovision\n\n**-o <path>, --output <path>**\n\nPath to write the re-signed application. Defaults to ``out`` in your current working directory.\n\n**-p <path>, --provisioning-profile <path>**\n\nPath to your provisioning profile. This should be associated with your certificate. Defaults to \n``$HOME/.isign/isign.mobileprovision``.\n\n**-v, --verbose**\n\nMore verbose logs will be printed to STDERR.\n\n**Application path**\n\nThe app to be resigned is specified on the command line after other arguments. The application path is \ntypically an IPA, but can also be a ``.app`` directory or even a zipped ``.app`` directory. When\nresigning, ``isign`` will always create an archive of the same type as the original.\n\n\n.. _Contributing:\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nSauce Labs open source projects have a `Code of Conduct <CONDUCT.md>`__. In short, we try to respect each other, \nlisten, and be helpful.\n\nDevelopment happens on `our Github repository <https://github.com/saucelabs/isign>`__. File an issue, or fork the code!\n\nYou'll probably want to create some kind of python virtualenv, so you don't have to touch your system python or its \nlibraries. `virtualenvwrapper <https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__ is a good tool for this.\n\nThen, just do the following:\n\n.. code::\n\n  $ git clone https://github.com/saucelabs/isign.git\n  $ cd isign\n  $ dev/setup.sh \n  $ ./run_tests.sh\n\nIf the tests don't pass please `file an issue <https://github.com/saucelabs/isign/issues>`__. Please keep the tests up to date as you develop.\n\nNote: some tests require Apple's\n`codesign <https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/codesign.1.html>`__\nto run, so they are skipped unless you run them on a Macintosh computer with developer tools.\n\nOkay, if all the tests passed, you now have an 'editable' install of isign. Any edits to this repo will affect (for instance)\nhow the `isign` command line tool works.\n\nSauce Labs supports ongoing public ``isign`` development. ``isign`` is a part of our infrastructure\nfor the `iOS Real Device Cloud <https://saucelabs.com/press-room/press-releases/sauce-labs-expands-mobile-test-automation-cloud-with-the-addition-of-real-devices-1>`__,\nwhich allows customers to test apps and websites on real iOS devices. ``isign`` has been successfully re-signing submitted customer apps in production\nsince June 2015.\n\n.. _More documentation:\n\nMore documentation\n------------------\n\nSee the `docs <docs>`__ directory of this repository for random stuff that didn't fit here.\n\n.. _Authors:\n\n\nAuthors\n-------\n\n`Neil Kandalgaonkar <https://github.com/neilk>`__ is the main developer and maintainer.\n\nProof of concept by `Steven Hazel <https://github.com/sah>`__ and Neil Kandalgaonkar.\n\nReference scripts using Apple tools by `Michael Han <https://github.com/mhan>`__.\n"

Iterate over nested, or multidimensional, hashes.\n\n## The Holiday Suppliers\n\n### Instructions\n\nYou have a bunch of decorations for various holidays organized by season.\n\n```ruby\nholiday_supplies = {\n  :winter => {\n    :christmas => [\"Lights\", \"Wreath\"],\n    :new_years => [\"Party Hats\"]\n  },\n  :summer => {\n    :fourth_of_july => [\"Fireworks\", \"BBQ\"]\n  },\n  :fall => {\n    :thanksgiving => [\"Turkey\"]\n  },\n  :spring => {\n    :memorial_day => [\"BBQ\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWrite your methods in `lib/holiday.rb`; use the comments in each method as\nguides.\n\n* Write a method that returns the second supply for the Fourth of July. For\n  example:\n\n```ruby\ndef second_supply_for_fourth_of_july(holiday_supplies)\n  holiday_supplies[:summer][:fourth_of_july][1]\nend\n```\n\n* Write a method that adds a supply to both Winter holidays.\n\n* Write a method that adds a supply to Memorial Day.\n\n* Write a method that adds a new holiday and its associated supplies to any\n  season.\n\n* Write a method to collect all Winter supplies from all the winter holidays.\n  For example:\n\n```bash\nwinter_supplies(holiday_supplies) #=> [\"Lights\", \"Wreath\", etc]\n```\n\n* Write a method that uses a loop to list out all the supplies you have for each\n  holiday and the season. Use string manipulation to get your output to match\n  what the test is expecting.\n\nHere are a few helpful tips:\n\n* Our hash keys are symbols. We need to convert them into strings. Use the\n  `.to_s` method on a symbol to convert it into a string.\n* Look closely at the output string that the test is expecting. You'll notice\n  that it expects holiday names, like \"New Years\", to have both words\n  capitalized. Ruby has a `.capitalize` method that you can call on a string.\n  **But, note:**\n  * `.capitalize` returns the capitalized string but *doesn't change* the\n    original string. So, when you call on that same string in the future, it\n    *isn't capitalized!* You can capitalize a string for now and evermore by\n    using the bang operator (`!`).\n  * You'll need to capitalize *both words* in a given holiday's name. If you\n    call `\"new years\".capitalize!`, it will return `\"New years\"`. In order to\n    capitalize *both* words, you'll need to `.split` the string into an array\n    and iterate over that array to `.capitalize!` each word in it. Then, you'll\n    need to `.join` the array back into a string.\n  * If you're unfamiliar with the methods mentioned above, look them up in the\n    Ruby documentation.\n\nExample of expected output:\n\n```\nWinter:\n  Christmas: Lights, Wreath\n  New Years: Party Hats\n```\n\n* Write a method to collect all holidays with \"BBQ\" in the supply array. The\n  method should behave as seen below:\n\n```bash\nholidays_with_bbqs(holiday_supplies)\n#=> [:fourth_of_july, :memorial_day]\n```\n\n**Reminder:** This is a challenging lab, so remember to use Pry, Google, and the Flatiron School community to help you get the tests passing.\n\n## Resources\n\n* [StackOverflow: Accessing Elements of Nested Hashes in Ruby](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5544858/accessing-elements-of-nested-hashes-in-ruby)\n\n* [honeybadger - Advanced Ruby Hash Techniques](http://blog.honeybadger.io/advanced-ruby-hash-techniques/)\n"

  "readme_contents": "AppleWirelessKeyboard for Wired Keyboards\n=========================================\n\nThis is a simple modification of the original AppleWirelessKeyboard helper \nutility by [uxsoft](http://uxsoft.cz/projects/applewirelesskeyboard/) which\nalso includes some basic support for the wired variant of the Apple Keyboard.\n\nThis utility isn't really useful or needed if you're running BootCamp on a real\nMac. Just stick with the Apple BootCamp stuff.\n\n**Please note that this tool still doesn't make the Fn key on a wired keyboard\nwork**. It just provides wired keyboard users with some decent alternatives.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n[Download AppleWirelessKeyboard.exe](https://github.com/gered/AppleWirelessKeyboard/releases)\n\nBuild or download the executable AppleWirelessKeyboard.exe and run it. By\ndefault it will be configured for use with a wireless keyboard. To enable the\nwired keyboard fixes, right click the AppleWirelessKeyboard icon in your system\ntray and choose \"Configure.\"\n\nTo fix Eject key handling so that you can use it to toggle between the function\nkeys working as on Windows or Mac once again, check \"Wired Keyboard.\"\n\nYou can also use the Eject key to emulate the Fn key by checking the last\noption. This makes it so that you can press Eject + F1 - F12 and have\nit work in the same exact manner as pressing Fn + F1 - F12 would.\n\n\nWhy?\n----\n\nThe original AppleWirelessKeyboard utility is not able to read the state of the \n'Fn' key at all when using a wired keyboard. This _appears_ to be a driver issue, \nbut I'm by no means an expert on low-level driver stuff in Windows so maybe it \nis possible to fix this. It doesn't seem to matter if you're using the default \nWindows provided driver, or the Apple driver from Lion's BootCamp driver \ncollection... the 'Fn' key remains unreadable via this code.\n\nUsing the Apple driver with the wired keyboard, at least for me, only seems to \nget you half-way there. Next/Previous/Play Fn key combos work, but the volume \ncontrol key combos don't. Plus you don't get the nice OSD icons when you press \nthem. And again, even with the Apple driver installed, this utility is still not\nable to read the state of the 'Fn' key.\n\nBasically, I could find no solution at all which worked the way I wanted it to\nwith my wired keyboard.\n\nAfter playing with the original code for AppleWirelessKeyboard from \n[CodePlex](http://applewirelesskbrd.codeplex.com/) I noticed that the Eject key\nwas still recognized somewhat. Just in a slightly different way then how the\noriginal code was set up to recognize it. So, with some minor code tweaks, I\nwas able to fix the code so that the Eject key would work with wired keyboards \nto allow F key toggling like with a wireless keyboard.\n\nIssues / Missing Functionality\n------------------------------\n\n* The code using iTunesLib has been commented out. I don't use iTunes nor do I have it installed, therefore I don't have a copy of this library so I couldn't build the code until I removed it. I guess it's possible that the default Windows media key mappings for Eject/Fn+F7-F9 could maybe work with iTunes? No idea.\n* No automatic detection of which keyboard you are using (wired or wireless). I'd like to do this, but don't have a wireless keyboard for reference. You will need to set your config manually.\n* 'Fn' key combos still do not work with a wired keyboard. Use the Eject key to toggle F key functionality or enable the Fn key emulation option to use Eject as a substitute Fn key to access Fn key combos.\n* The \"Restart\" option is gone. This doesn't have a built-in equivalent in WPF.\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n* Fixes virtual key codes used for Home, End, Page Up and Page Down keys (the Fn + Arrow combos available on wireless keyboards).\n* Config settings are now saved. When you re-open the tool your last settings will still be there.\n* The system tray icon now disappears when the tool is closed and the tool now closes properly (the \"WPF way\").\n"

  "repo": "zoul/Finch",
  "language": "Objective-C",
  "readme_contents": "About\n=====\n\nFinch is a simple OpenAL-based sound effect player for iOS. The reasons for writing Finch instead of sticking with Apple\u2019s `AVAudioPlayer` are described in my [question on Stack Overflow][so]. The goals are simple: (1) Play sound effects without much fuss, and (2) do not lag in the `play` method as `AVAudioPlayer` does. Finch is not meant to play background music. If you want\nto play background music, you can go with `AVAudioPlayer`. Finch will play the sound effects over the background music just fine.\n\n[so]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/986983\n\nInstalling\n==========\n\nFinch is a static library. Your best bet is to use the \u201cworkspace\u201d Xcode\u00a04 feature, adding the Finch project into your project\u2019s workspace and linking the appropriate target against `libFinch`. The only remaining thing is taking care of headers. This is a bit clumsy (see [another SO question][headers]), but in essence you can put Finch into a folder inside your project (say `Support`) and set the user header search path to this folder and below (`Support/**`).\n\nIf you are unsure about the instructions above, please see the [Xcode 4 static libraries][tutorial] tutorial by Jonah Williams.\n\n[headers]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6289999\n[tutorial]: http://blog.carbonfive.com/2011/04/04/using-open-source-static-libraries-in-xcode-4/#using_a_static_library\n\nUsing\n=====\n\nAfter you link against the library and import the headers you may start using the code:\n\n    #import \"FISoundEngine.h\"\n\n    NSError *error = nil;\n    FISoundEngine *engine = [FISoundEngine sharedEngine];\n    FISound *sound = [engine soundNamed:@\"finch.wav\" maxPolyphony:4 error:&error];\n    if (!sound) {\n        NSLog(@\"Failed to load sound: %@\", error);\n    } else {\n        [sound play];\n    }\n\nSound loaded without the `maxPolyphony` argument will only play with one \u201cvoice\u201d at a time. If you call `play` before such sound is finished, it will play again from the start:\n\n    -----------------> time\n    ra\n      ra\n        rapid fire!\n\nIf you wish to overlay multiple instances of the sound, set the `maxPolyphony` argument to maximum number of sounds that you need to layer:\n\n    -----------------> time\n    rapid fire!\n      rapid fire!\n        rapid fire!\n\nAnd please note that Finch does not yet support compressed audio. You should be safe with 8-bit or 16-bit mono or stereo little-endian WAV files sampled at 44.1\u00a0kHz. There is a demo target inside the project, take a look at it to see more.\n\nAudio Interruption Handling\n===========================\n\nYour app\u2019s audio session may be interrupted at any moment, be it with an incoming call, the iPod playback being started or whatever else. In this case you are reponsible for correctly suspending your audio session and resuming it later when the interruption ends. This is a bit hard, since the sound system is very particular about your suspend and resume code.\n\nFinch currently supports suspend and resume with the `suspended` property of the `FISoundEngine` class. When you receive an interruption notification or callback from the system, you can set this property to `YES` and later flip it to `NO` when the interruption has ended. There\u2019s a slight catch, though \u2013 when your app receives a notification about the interruption being ended, your app still may be in background and therefore it can\u2019t resume the sound session right away. You have to wait until the app is active again and only then resume the sound engine. See the application delegate in the demo project about how this can be done. (Also notice that the audio session delegates, callbacks and notifications differ between iOS versions.)\n\nFurther info may be found in the documentation for the `AVAudioSession` class.\n\nHacking\n=======\n\nThe `FISoundEngine` and `FISound` classes are just a thin layer atop of the plumbing classes that implement the actual OpenAL primitives. See the Xcode project to learn more, it\u2019s fairly easy to do your own things if you need to. Some links you might find useful:\n\n* [An iPhone OpenAL brain dump][dump]\n* [OpenAL Programmer\u2019s Guide][guide]\n\n[dump]: http://www.subfurther.com/blog/?p=602\n[guide]: http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Documentation/OpenAL_Programmers_Guide.pdf\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nThe code is offered under the [MIT License][license].

Thanks to @sami-mw!__\n\n__UPDATE Oct 2015: The patch was modified for kernel 4.2 and support of Macbook Pro 2015. Thanks to @Aetf!__\n\n\n### About\n\nA patched version of hid-apple allows GNU/Linux user **to swap the FN and left Control keys and some other mapping tweaks** on Macbook Pro, external Apple keyboards and probably other Apple devices.\n\nThe patch was created by [free5lot](https://github.com/free5lot) under GPL 2 (or later) licence. I hope it'll go to upstream kernel, so more GNU/Linux users could make their keyboards more comfortable for them.\n\nThis project was inspired by a [similar patch](https://github.com/JanmanX/HID-Apple) made by [JanmanX (Jan Meznik)](https://github.com/JanmanX). His patch has the same idea but a bit different realization. I'd like to thank him for solving this problem in the first place and making his solution public.\n\n\n### Problem\n\nThis patch was created because Apple keyboards on Macbook Pro and external keyboard models have an awful location of special keys. To make it more habitual and friendly the fn key and left Control key should be swapped.\n\nThe swapping of Alt (Option) and Command is already possible without a patch by setting swap_opt_cmd=1 option to hid-apple kernel module in current versions of Linux kernel.\nMore information is available at [Ubuntu's help website](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AppleKeyboard#Mapping_keys_.28Insert.2C_Alt.2C_Cmd.2C_etc..29).\n\n\n### Installation via [DKMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Kernel_Module_Support) (recommended)\n\nYou may need to install git and dkms first, e.g. on Ubuntu: `sudo apt install git dkms`\n\nClone this repo and go into the source code directory:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/free5lot/hid-apple-patched\ncd hid-apple-patched\n```\nInstall module:\n```bash\nsudo dkms add .\nsudo dkms build hid-apple/1.0\nsudo dkms install hid-apple/1.0\n```\nThen, create file `/etc/modprobe.d/hid_apple.conf`. The following configuration emulates a standard PC layout:\n```\noptions hid_apple fnmode=2\noptions hid_apple swap_fn_leftctrl=1\noptions hid_apple swap_opt_cmd=1\noptions hid_apple rightalt_as_rightctrl=1\noptions hid_apple ejectcd_as_delete=1\n```\nFinally, apply the new config file:\n```bash\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n```\nTo (re-)load the module for immediate use, run\n```bash\nsudo modprobe -r hid_apple; sudo modprobe hid_apple\n```\nin one go (since the first command will disable your Apple keyboard). Alternatively, run `sudo reboot`, and the new module should be loaded on reboot.\n\nThe advantage of DKMS is that the module is automatically re-built after every kernel upgrade and installation. This method has been tested at least on Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04.\n\n### Note about installation on Mint and some others distros\nDKMS config of this repo has option `DEST_MODULE_LOCATION` set to `/extra`. That's the place compiled patched module will be placed.\nDistributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, Suse and some others ignore this parameter and use the proper distribution-specific directory instead. There will be no issues with these distributions.\nOther distributions like Mint can use `DEST_MODULE_LOCATION` and may require an extra configuration file to be created by the user to force the use of patched version of `hid-apple` from `/extra` instead of original one.\nIn this case a new file `/etc/depmod.d/hid-apple.conf` should be created which tells depmod to prefer the module in `/extra` (see `man 5 depmod.d`):\n```\noverride hid-apple * extra\n```\nThe configuration file needs to be there before the module is installed using DKMS. \nSee additional information about it from @bambinodino (who pointed this out) in the issue #67.\n\n### Installation on Arch Linux\n\nAn AUR package [hid-apple-patched-git-dkms](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hid-apple-patched-git-dkms/) is available to automate the above installation steps.\n\nSee the [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Apple_Keyboard#Use_a_patch_to_hid-apple) for install and configuration instructions specific to Arch Linux.\n\n### Configuration\n\nPermanent configuration is done in file `/etc/modprobe.d/hid_apple.conf`. The format is one option-value pair per line, like `swap_fn_leftctrl=1`. After writing to the file, do `sudo update-initramfs -u` and reboot.\nTemporary configuration (applies immediately but is lost after rebooting) is possible by writing to virtual files in `/sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/`, like `echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/swap_fn_leftctrl`.\n\nThese options are from the original mainstream `hid-apple` module:\n- `fnmode` - Mode of top-row keys\n  - `0` = disabled\n  - `1` = normally media keys, switchable to function keys by holding Fn key (Default)\n  - `2` = normally function keys, switchable to media keys by holding Fn key\n- `swap_opt_cmd` - Swap the Option (\\\"Alt\\\") and Command (\\\"Flag\\\") keys\n  - `0` = as silkscreened, Mac layout (Default)\n  - `1` = swapped, PC layout\n- `swap_fn_leftctrl` - Swap the Fn and left Control keys\n  - `0` = as silkscreened, Mac layout (Default)\n  - `1` = swapped, PC layout\n- `iso_layout` - Enable/Disable hardcoded ISO-layout of the keyboard. Possibly relevant for international keyboard layouts\n  - `0` = disabled, \n  - `1` = enabled (Default)\n\nAnd these options were added in the patched version:\n- `rightalt_as_rightctrl` - Use the right Alt key as a right Ctrl key\n  - `0` = as silkscreened, Mac layout (Default)\n  - `1` = swapped, PC layout\n- `ejectcd_as_delete` - Use Eject-CD key as Delete key, if available\n  - `0` = disabled (Default)\n  - `1` = enabled\n- `swap_fn_f13_insert` - Swap the Fn and f13 keys, making Fn Insert and f13 Fn. For people who need Insert\n  - `0` = disabled (Default), \n  - `1` = enabled\n\nNote: `swap_fn_f13_insert` will be ignored if `swap_fn_leftctrl` is activated.\n\n### Warning regarding Secure Boot (on non-Apple computers)\n\nSome distributions, including Ubuntu 16.04, require that all modules are signed if Secure Boot is enabled. This breaks all third-party modules. There are various work-arounds, the easiest of which is to disable secure boot. This is currently not an issue on Apple computers, because Apple firmware does not support Secure Boot. See [issue #23](https://github.com/free5lot/hid-apple-patched/issues/23).\n\n\n### Alternative, script-based installation\n\nBuild and install via scripts provided:\n```bash\n./build.sh\n\n./install.sh\n```\nThe script will create `/etc/modprobe.d/hid_apple.conf` for you, after asking a few questions.\n\nThis process needs to be repeated after installing a new kernel, after having booted into the new kernel.\n\n\n### Alternative, makefile-based installation\n\n0. To build make sure you have the kernel development packages for your\ndistribution installed. For example in Ubuntu these packages are called `linux-headers-*`, where \"*\" indicates the version and variant of the kernel.\n\n1. The default kernel header directory in the Makefile is:\n`/usr/src/linux-headers-$(shell uname -r)`, it automatically detects and uses the version of running kernel. \nIt works in Ubuntu and a lot of other GNU/Linux distributions, just skip this step if you use them.\nBut if in your distribution the kernel header directory is different from the default one in\nthe Makefile export the correct one:\n```bash\nexport LINUX_HEADER_DIR=/path/to/kernel/header/dir\n```\n2. To build:\n```bash\nmake\n```\n3. To install:\n```bash\nmake install\n```\n4. The install will put the module in the 'extra' sub-directory and the\ndefault unpatched module will take priority. To give your newly built\nmodule priority create a file '/etc/depmod.d/hid-apple.conf' and add\nthe following line:\n```\noverride hid_apple * extra\n```\nThen run:\n```bash\nsudo depmod -a\n```\n5. And update of initramfs maybe required:\n```bash\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n```\n\n\n### Limitations\n\nMacbook keyboards have no issues nor limitations regarding this patched module. But some External Keyboards (like Magic Keyboard A1255, A1644 and etc.) have a limitation (probably physical) related to the registration of keys from 5-T-G-B column with Fn+Command and Fn+Control being pressed simultaniously. More information can be found in [issue #6](https://github.com/free5lot/hid-apple-patched/issues/6). There is a workaround - to release the Fn key first in these combinations and it should work fine.\n\n\n### Topicality\n\nA lot of GNU/Linux users of Macbook Pro and/or external (wireless) keyboards face the problem of uncomfortable placement of keys.\nHere are some topics about swap of fn and left control keys, and all of them are checked **unsolved or/and closed**.\n- [Ubuntu Forums - swap fn and control key](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=785643)\n- [Stack Overflow - Is there any way to swap the fn (function) and control keys in linux on an macbook pro?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4767895/is-there-any-way-to-swap-the-fn-function-and-control-keys-in-linux-on-an-macbo)\n- [Ubuntu Forums - Swap fn and control keys](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2176248) \n- [Organic Design - Apple wireless keyboard on Linux](http://www.organicdesign.co.nz/Apple_wireless_keyboard_on_Linux)\n\nSo this patch is probably essential and desirable by users.\n\n\n### Links and mentions\n- [**ArchWiki** (documentation wiki of **Arch Linux**) - Apple Keyboard - Swap the Fn key and Left Ctrl key](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Apple_Keyboard#Use_a_patch_to_hid-apple) (added by @Aetf)).\n- [Official documentation of **openSUSE** - Installation on a Mac](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Installation_on_a_Mac#Other_things) (added by Cornertwist)\n- [Official documentation of **Ubuntu** - AppleKeyboard - Mapping keys](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AppleKeyboard#Mapping_keys_.28Insert.2C_Alt.2C_Cmd.2C_etc..29) (added by @Aetf).\n\n"

[Drop me a line](mailto:github@shiri.info).\n\n## What AppleGuice does for you? ##\n\nAppleGuice helps you write clean, reuseable and testable code by allowing you to easily inject your services to any class.\nOther dependency injection frameworks require binding, xml editing or initializing your classes with a special method.\nWith AppleGuice all you have to do is declare the injected type and thats it. As a bonus, you will still be able to initialize classes with `[[MyClass alloc] init]` so it is even easier to integrate it with your existing code base.\n\n## Show Me ##\n\n### Inject your first injectable instance with 3 simple steps: ###\n\n#### Start AppleGuice ####\n```objectivec\n\n//AppDelegate.m\n\n#import <AppleGuice/AppleGuice.h>\n\n+(void) initialize {\n    [AppleGuice startService];\n}\n```\n#### Create your injectable service ####\nMark your injectable service with the protocol `AppleGuiceInjectable` so AppleGuice will find it.\n```objectivec\n\n@protocol MyServiceProtocol <AppleGuiceInjectable>\n\n-(void) doStuff;\n\n@end\n\n@interface MyService : NSObject<MyServiceProtocol>\n@end\n\n@implementation MyService\n...\n@end\n```\n\n#### Enjoy automatic injection while coding ####\nCreate an ivar prefixed with the ioc prefix (the default is `_ioc_`).\nAppleGuice will automatically inject the proper implementation when calling the init method.\n```objectivec\n//MyClass.h\n@interface MyClass : NSObject\n\n@property (nonatomic, strong) id<MyServiceProtocol> ioc_myService;\n\n@end\n\n//MyClass.m\n@implementation MyClass\n\n//Now, you can use _ioc_myService anywhere. Even in the init function!\n\n-(id) init {\n  self = [super init];\n  [self.ioc_myService doStuff];\n  return self;\n}\n@end\n```\nAppleGuice initialized `_ioc_myService`  without any manual binding!\n\n#### Stub with ease while testing ####\n```objectivec\n#import <AppleGuice/AppleGuice.h>\n\n@implementation MyClassTests {\n    MyClass* classUnderTest;\n}\n\n-(void)setUp\n{\n    [super setUp];\n    [AppleGuice startService];\n    [AppleGuice setInstanceCreationPolicy:AppleGuiceInstanceCreationPolicyCreateMocks];\n    classUnderTest = [[MyClass alloc] init];\n}\n\n-(void) test_foo_returnsValue {\n  //the injectable ivar is initialized with a mock. You can stub methods on it as you normally do with OCMock.\n  [[[classUnderTest.ioc_myService expect] andReturn:@\"someString\"] doStuff:OCMOCK_ANY];\n  \n  [classUnderTest foo];\n  \n  [classUnderTest.ioc_myService verify];\n}\n```\n*When testing, AppleGuice works best with [OCMock](http://ocmock.org/).\n\n## Inject In every flavour ##\nInjecting a service is done by declering an ivar in a class. You can add it in the interface, implementation, as a property or even inside a private category. AppleGuice will find it.\nInjection comes in three flavours:\n```objectivec\n@interface MyClass () {\n    MyService* _ioc_MyService; //will create an instance of MyService.\n    id<MyServiceProtocol> _ioc_MyService //will create an instance of the first class conforming to MyServiceProtocol.\n    NSArray* _ioc_MyProtocol //will return an array containing instances of all classes conforming to MyProtocol\n}\n```\n\n## More features ##\n\n### Singletons in a snap ###\nInstead of messing your code with shared instance declerations or macros, you can just add `AppleGuiceSingleton` to the implemented protocols list and AppleGuice will always return the same instance.\n```objectivec\n@protocol MyServiceProtocol <AppleGuiceInjectable, AppleGuiceSingleton>\n@end\n```\n\n### Circular dependency support ###\nAppleGuice can handle circular depenency between injected classes as long as the dependent classes conforms to `AppleGuiceSingleton`.\n\n### LazyLoad objects ###\nYou can configure AppleGuice to inject a proxy object instead of the real service. Once the service is needed (A method in the service is called) the proxy will be replaced with the real object.\n```objectivec\n//add in your AppDelegate\n[AppleGuice setInstanceCreationPolicy:AppleGuiceInstanceCreationPolicyLazyLoad];\n```\n\n## Ready to start? ##\nCheck out the quick [installation guide](https://github.com/tomersh/AppleGuice/wiki/AppleGuice-Installation-Guide).\n\nDocumentation can be found [here](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/AppleGuice).\n[![githalytics.com alpha](https://cruel-carlota.pagodabox.com/e73586a87135304cb47ff18e519b75f6 \"githalytics.com\")](http://githalytics.com/tomersh/AppleGuice)\n"

  "readme_contents": "# xctool\n\n__xctool__ is an extension for Apple's __xcodebuild__ which makes it\neasier to test iOS and Mac products.  It's especially helpful\nfor continuous integration.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/xctool.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/xctool)\n\n[ [Features](#features) &bull; [Requirements](#requirements) &bull; [Usage](#usage)\n&bull; [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration)\n&bull; [Reporters](#reporters) &bull;\n[Configuration](#configuration-xctool-args) &bull; \n[Contributing](#contributing) &bull; [Known Issues & Tips](#known-issues--tips) &bull; [License](#license) ]\n\n## Features\n\n__xctool__ is drop-in replacement for `xcodebuild test` that adds a few\nextra features:\n\n* **Faster, parallelized test runs.**\n\n  _xctool_ can optionally run all of your test bundles in parallel,\nspeeding up your test runs significantly.  At Facebook, we've seen 2x\nand 3x speed ups by parallelizing our runs.\n\n  Use the `-parallelize` option with _run-tests_ or _test_ to enable.\nSee [Parallelizing Test Runs](#parallelizing-test-runs) for more info.\n\n* **Structured output of test results.**\n\n  _xctool_ captures all test results as structured JSON objects.  If\nyou're building a continuous integration system, this means you don't\nhave to regex parse _xcodebuild_ output anymore.\n\n  Try one of the [Reporters](#reporters) to customize the output or get\nthe full event stream with the `-reporter json-stream` option.\n\n* **Human-friendly, ANSI-colored output.**\n\n  _xcodebuild_ is incredibly verbose, printing the full compile command\nand output for every source file.  By default, _xctool_ is only verbose\nif something goes wrong, making it much easier to identify where the\nproblems are.\n\n  Example:\n\n\t![pretty output](https://fpotter_public.s3.amazonaws.com/xctool-uicatalog.gif)\n\n* **Written in Objective-C.**\n\n  _xctool_ is written in Objective-C. Mac OS X and iOS developers can\neasily submit new features and fix any bugs they may encounter without\nlearning a new language. We very much welcome pull requests!\n\n\n**Note:** Support for building projects with xctool is deprecated and will\nnot be updated to support future versions of Xcode. We suggest moving to\n`xcodebuild` (with [xcpretty](https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty)) for\nsimple needs, or [xcbuild](https://github.com/facebook/xcbuild) for more\ninvolved requirements. xctool will continue to support testing (see above).\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Xcode 7 or higher\n* You'll need Xcode's Command Line Tools installed.  From Xcode, install\nvia _Xcode &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Downloads_.\n\n## Installation\n\nxctool can be installed from homebrew via \n```bash\nbrew install xctool\n```\n\nor can be downloaded and run via the xctool.sh command. \n\n## Usage\n\nxctool's commands and options are mostly a superset of xcodebuild's.  In\nmost cases, you can just swap __xcodebuild__ with __xctool__ and things will\nrun as expected but with more attractive output.\n\nYou can always get help and a full list of options with:\n\n```bash\npath/to/xctool.sh -help\n```\n\n### Testing\n\n_xctool_ has a __run-tests__ action which knows how to run the\ntests in your scheme.  You can optionally limit what tests are run\nor change the SDK they're run against.\n\nTo run all tests in your scheme, you would use:\n\n```bash\npath/to/xctool.sh \\\n  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \\\n  -scheme YourScheme \\\n  run-tests\n```\n\nTo run just the tests in a specific target, use the `-only` option:\n\n```bash\npath/to/xctool.sh \\\n  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \\\n  -scheme YourScheme \\\n  run-tests -only SomeTestTarget\n```\n\nYou can go further and just run a specific test class:\n\n```bash\npath/to/xctool.sh \\\n  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \\\n  -scheme YourScheme \\\n  run-tests -only SomeTestTarget:SomeTestClass\n```\n\nOr, even further and run just a single test method:\n\n```bash\npath/to/xctool.sh \\\n  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \\\n  -scheme YourScheme \\\n  run-tests -only SomeTestTarget:SomeTestClass/testSomeMethod\n```\n\nYou can also specify prefix matching for classes or test methods:\n\n```bash\npath/to/xctool.sh \\\n  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \\\n  -scheme YourScheme \\\n  run-tests -only SomeTestTarget:SomeTestClassPrefix*,SomeTestClass/testSomeMethodPrefix*\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can omit a specific item by prefix matching for classes or test methods:\n\n```bash\npath/to/xctool.sh \\\n  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \\\n  -scheme YourScheme \\\n  run-tests -omit SomeTestTarget:SomeTestClass/testSomeMethodPrefix*\n```\n\nYou can also run tests against a different SDK:\n\n```bash\npath/to/xctool.sh \\\n  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \\\n  -scheme YourScheme \\\n  run-tests -test-sdk iphonesimulator5.1\n```\n\nOptionally you can specify `-testTimeout` when running tests. When an individual\ntest hits this timeout, it is considered a failure rather than waiting indefinitely. \nThis can prevent your test run from deadlocking forever due to misbehaving tests.\n\nBy default application tests will wait at most 30 seconds for the simulator\nto launch. If you need to change this timeout, use the `-launch-timeout` option.\n\n#### Building Tests\n\nBefore running tests you need to build them. You can use __xcodebuild__,  __xcbuild__ or __Buck__ to do that. \n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\nxcodebuild \\\n  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \\\n  -scheme YourScheme \\\n  build-for-testing\n```\n\n\n\n##### Xcode 7\n\nIf you are using Xcode 7 for building you can continue using xctool to build tests using\n__build-tests__ or just use __test__ actions to run tests.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\npath/to/xctool.sh \\\n  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \\\n  -scheme YourScheme \\\n  build-tests\n```\n\nYou can optionally just build a single test target with the `-only` option:\n\n```bash\npath/to/xctool.sh \\\n  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \\\n  -scheme YourScheme \\\n  build-tests -only SomeTestTarget\n```\n\n\n#### Parallelizing Test Runs\n\n_xctool_ can optionally run unit tests in parallel, making better use of\notherwise idle CPU cores.  At Facebook, we've seen 2x and 3x gains by\nparallelizing our test runs.\n\nTo allow test bundles to run concurrently, use the `-parallelize`\noption:\n\n```bash\npath/to/xctool.sh \\\n  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \\\n  -scheme YourScheme \\\n  run-tests -parallelize\n```\n\nThe above gives you parallelism, but you're bounded by your slowest test\nbundle.  For example, if you had two test bundles ('A' and 'B'), but 'B'\ntook 10 times as long to run because it contained 10 times as many\ntests, then the above parallelism won't help much.\n\nYou can get further gains by breaking your test execution into buckets\nusing the `-logicTestBucketSize` option:\n\n```bash\npath/to/xctool.sh \\\n  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \\\n  -scheme YourScheme \\\n  run-tests -parallelize -logicTestBucketSize 20\n```\n\nThe above will break your test execution into buckets of _20_ test\ncases each, and those bundles will be run concurrently.  If some of your\ntest bundles are much larger than others, this will help even things out\nand speed up the overall test run.\n\n### Building (Xcode 7 only)\n\n**Note:** Support for building projects with xctool is deprecated and isn't\nsupported in Xcode 8 and later. We suggest moving to `xcodebuild` (with \n[xcpretty](https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty)) for\nsimple needs, or [xcbuild](https://github.com/facebook/xcbuild) for more\ninvolved requirements. Alternatively, you can use [Buck](https://buckbuild.com/).\n\nBuilding products with _xctool_ is the same as building them with\n_xcodebuild_.\n\nIf you use workspaces and schemes:\n\n```bash\npath/to/xctool.sh \\\n  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \\\n  -scheme YourScheme \\\n  build\n```\n\nIf you use projects and schemes:\n\n```bash\npath/to/xctool.sh \\\n  -project YourProject.xcodeproj \\\n  -scheme YourScheme \\\n  build\n```\n\nAll of the common options like `-configuration`, `-sdk`, `-arch` work\njust as they do with _xcodebuild_.\n\nNOTE: _xctool_ doesn't support directly building targets using\n`-target`; you must use schemes.\n\n## Continuous Integration\n\nxctool is an excellent choice for running your tests under a continuous\nintegration server such as [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) or [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/).\nTo run tests within a continuous integration environment,\nyou must create **Shared Schemes** for your application target and ensure that all dependencies (such as CocoaPods) are added explicitly to the Scheme. To do so:\n\n1. Open up the **Manage Schemes** sheet by selecting the **Product** menu > **Schemes** > **Manage Schemes...**\n1. Locate your application target in the list. Ensure that the **Shared** checkbox in far right hand column of the sheet is checked.\n1. If your application or test targets include cross-project dependencies such as CocoaPods, then you will need to ensure that they have been\nconfigured as explicit dependencies. To do so:\n    1. Highlight your application target and hit the **Edit...** button to open the Scheme editing sheet.\n    1. Click the **Build** tab in the left-hand panel of the Scheme editor.\n    1. Click the **+** button and add each dependency to the project. CocoaPods will appear as a static library named **Pods**.\n    1. Drag the dependency above your application target so that it is built first.\n\nYou will now have a new file in the **xcshareddata/xcschemes** directory underneath your Xcode project. This is the\nshared Scheme that you just configured. Check this file into your repository and xctool will be able to find and execute\nyour tests on the next CI build.\n\n### Example Travis CI Configuration\n\n[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is a very popular continuous\nintegration system offered for free to Open Source projects.  It\nintegrates well with Github, and it now uses _xctool_ as the default\nbuild and test tool for Objective-C projects.  Once you have set up your\nshared Scheme for use with xctool, you will need to configure a\n`.travis.yml` file.\n\nIf you're using workspaces, your `.travis.yml` might be:\n\n```yaml\nlanguage: objective-c\nxcode_workspace: path/to/YourApp.xcworkspace\nxcode_scheme: YourApp\n```\n\nIf you're using projects, your `.travis.yml` might be:\n\n```yaml\nlanguage: objective-c\nxcode_project: path/to/YourApp.xcodeproj\nxcode_scheme: YourApp\n```\n\nFor more flexibility, you can also control how Travis installs and\ninvokes xctool:\n\n```yaml\nlanguage: objective-c\nbefore_install:\n    - brew update\n    - brew install xctool\nscript: xctool -workspace MyApp.xcworkspace -scheme MyApp test\n```\n\nYou can learn more about the Travis CI environment for iOS and OS X\napplication by referring to the [About OS X Travis CI\nEnvironment](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/osx-ci-environment/)\ndocument and find in-depth documentation for configuring your project by\nconsulting the [Getting\nStarted](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/getting-started/) page.\n\n## Reporters\n\nxctool has reporters that output build and test results in different\nformats.  If you do not specify any reporters yourself, xctool uses\nthe `pretty` and `user-notifications` reporters by default. xctool also\nhas these special rules:\n\n* Overwrite is disabled on the `pretty` reporter when xctool does not\ndetect a TTY. This can be overridden by setting `XCTOOL_FORCE_TTY` in\nthe environment.\n* The `user-notifications` reporter will not be used\nif xctool detects that the build is being run by Travis CI, CircleCI, TeamCity,\nor Jenkins (i.e. `TRAVIS=true`, `CIRCLECI=true`, `TEAMCITY_VERSION`, or\n`JENKINS_URL` in the environment).\n\nYou can choose your own reporters with the `-reporter` option:\n\n```bash\npath/to/xctool.sh \\\n  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \\\n  -scheme YourScheme \\\n  -reporter plain \\\n  build\n```\n\nBy default, reporters output to standard out, but you can also direct\nthe output to a file by adding `:OUTPUT_PATH` after the reporter name:\n\n```bash\npath/to/xctool.sh \\\n  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \\\n  -scheme YourScheme \\\n  -reporter plain:/path/to/plain-output.txt \\\n  build\n```\n\nYou can use as many reporters as you like; just use the `-reporter`\noption multiple times.\n\n### Included Reporters\n\n* __pretty__: a text-based reporter that uses ANSI colors and unicode\nsymbols for pretty output (the default).\n* __plain__: like _pretty_, but with no colors or unicode.\n* __phabricator__: outputs a JSON array of build/test results which can\nbe fed into the [Phabricator](http://phabricator.org/) code-review tool.\n* __junit__: produces a JUnit/xUnit compatible XML file with test\nresults.\n* __json-stream__: a stream of build/test events as JSON dictionaries,\none per line [(example\noutput)](https://gist.github.com/fpotter/82ffcc3d9a49d10ee41b).\n* __json-compilation-database__: outputs a [JSON Compilation Database](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html) of build events which can be used by [Clang Tooling](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibTooling.html) based tools, e.g. [OCLint](http://oclint.org).\n* __user-notifications__: sends notification to Notification Center when action is completed [(example notifications)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1044236/2771974/a2715306-ca74-11e3-9889-fa50607cc412.png).\n* __teamcity__: sends service messages to [TeamCity](http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) Continuous Integration Server\n\n### Implementing Your Own Reporters\n\nYou can also implement your own reporters using whatever language you\nlike.  Reporters in xctool are separate executables that read JSON\nobjects from STDIN and write formatted results to STDOUT.\n\nYou can invoke reporters by passing their full path via the `-reporter`\noption:\n\n```bash\npath/to/xctool.sh \\\n  -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace \\\n  -scheme YourScheme \\\n  -reporter /path/to/your/reporter \\\n  test\n```\n\nFor example, here's a simple reporter in Python that outputs a _period_\nfor every passing test and an _exclamation mark_ for every failing test:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nimport fileinput\nimport json\nimport sys\n\nfor line in fileinput.input():\n    obj = json.loads(line)\n\n    if obj['event'] == 'end-test':\n        if obj['succeeded']:\n            sys.stdout.write('.')\n        else:\n            sys.stdout.write('!')\n\nsys.stdout.write('\\n')\n```\n\nIf you're writing a reporter in Objective-C, you'll find the\n`Reporter` class helpful - see [Reporter.h](https://github.com/facebook/xctool/blob/master/Common/Reporter.h).\n\n\n## Configuration (.xctool-args)\n\nIf you routinely need to pass many arguments to _xctool_ on the\ncommand-line, you can use an __.xctool-args__ file to speed up your workflow.\nIf _xctool_ finds an __.xctool-args__ file in the current directory, it\nwill automatically pre-populate its arguments from there.\n\nThe format is just a JSON array of arguments:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"-workspace\", \"YourWorkspace.xcworkspace\",\n  \"-scheme\", \"YourScheme\",\n  \"-configuration\", \"Debug\",\n  \"-sdk\", \"iphonesimulator\",\n  \"-arch\", \"i386\"\n]\n```\n\nAny extra arguments you pass on the command-line will take precedence \nover those in the _.xctool-args_ file.\n\n## Contributing\n\nBug fixes, improvements, and especially new\n[Reporter](#reporters)\nimplementations are welcome.  Before submitting a [pull\nrequest](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests), please\nbe sure to sign the [Facebook\nContributor License\nAgreement](https://developers.facebook.com/opensource/cla).  We can't\naccept pull requests unless it's been signed.\n\n#### Workflow \n\n1. Fork.\n2. Make a feature branch: __git checkout -b my-feature__\n3. Make your feature.  Keep things tidy so you have one commit per self-contained change (squashing can help).\n3. Push your branch to your fork: __git push -u origin my-feature__\n4. Open GitHub, under \"Your recently pushed branches\", click __Pull\n   Request__ for _my-feature_.\n\nBe sure to use a separate feature branch and pull request for every\nself-contained feature.  If you need to make changes from feedback, make\nthe changes in place rather than layering on commits (use interactive\nrebase to edit your earlier commits).  Then use __git push --force\norigin my-feature__ to update your pull request.\n\n#### Workflow (for Facebook people, other committers)\n\nMostly the same, but use branches in the main xctool repo if you prefer.\nIt's a nice way to keep things together.\n\n1. Make a feature branch: __git checkout -b myusername/my-feature__\n2. Push your branch: __git push -u origin myusername/my-feature__\n3. Open GitHub to [facebook/xctool](https://github.com/facebook/xctool),\n   under \"Your recently pushed branches\", click __Pull Request__ for\n   _myusername/my-feature_.\n\n## Known Issues & Tips\n\n* __Use shared schemes and disable the Autocreate Schemes feature.__\n\n  Xcode has two kinds of schemes: shared, and user.  User schemes are\n  the default, and they're stored under a folder called `USERNAME.xcuserdatad`,\n  which most people correctly add to their _.gitignore_.\n\n  Use shared schemes instead, and commit them to your repo.  This way\n  everyone on your team (and your build server) are working from the\n  same information, and are building in the same way.\n  \n  ![example](https://fpotter_public.s3.amazonaws.com/xctool-shared-schemes.png)\n  \n* __Make sure simulators run in a GUI context__.\n\n  If you are running `xctool` in continuous integration, the user account\n  calling `xctool` **must** have an active GUI context.\n  If not, the simulator will fail to start with cryptic warnings like:\n  \n  ```\n  Tried to install the test host app 'com.myapp.test' but failed.\n  Preparing test environment failed.\n  -[TEST_BUNDLE FAILED_TO_START] \n  There was a problem starting the test bundle: Simulator 'iPhone 6' was not prepared: Failed for unknown reason.\n  Test did not run: Simulator 'iPhone 6' was not prepared: Failed for unknown reason.\n  2015-01-21 12:02:19.296 xcodebuild[35135:875297]  iPhoneSimulator: Timed out waiting 120 seconds for simulator to boot, current state is 1.\n  Testing failed:\n  Test target MyProjectTests encountered an error (Timed out waiting 120 seconds for simulator to boot, current state is 1.  \n  ```\n  \n  Note that the\n  same holds true with `xcodebuild`...this is not `xctool` specific.\n  \n  For more information, see [this post by Jason Jarrett](http://staxmanade.com/2015/01/setting-jenkins-up-to-run-xctool-and-xcode-simulator-tests/).\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2014-present Facebook\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may\nnot use this work except in compliance with the License.

This is the protocol that the Apple TV remote app uses, so this should enable the creation of an Apple TV remote app for various platforms. It can also be used in a `homebridge` plugin to connect Apple TV events to HomeKit and vice versa. `node-appletv` can be used as a standalone command line application, or as a module in your own node app. Keep reading for installation and usage instructions.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDeveloper documentation for `node-appletv` can be found [here](https://evandcoleman.github.io/node-appletv/).\n\n## Usage\n\n### As a standalone cli\n\n```bash\n# Install\n$ npm install -g node-appletv\n\n# Display built-in help\n$ appletv --help\n```\n\nThe `appletv` cli supports several commands, such as:\n\n`pair`: Scans for Apple TVs on the local network and initiates the pairing process\n\n`command <command>`: Execute a command on an Apple TV (play, pause, menu, volume, wake, suspend, etc.)\n\n`state`: Logs state changes from an Apple TV (now playing info)\n\n`queue`: Requests the current playback queue from an Apple TV\n\n`artwork`: Requests the current now playing artwork from an Apple TV\n\n`messages`: Logs all raw messages from an Apple TV\n\n`help <command>`: Get help for a specific command\n\n\n### As a node module\n\n```bash\n$ npm install --save node-appletv\n```\n\n`node-appletv` makes heavy use of Promises. All functions, except for the observe functions, return Promises.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Scan for Apple TVs and pair\n\n```typescript\nimport { scan } from 'node-appletv';\n\nlet devices = await scan();\n// devices is an array of AppleTV objects\nlet device = devices[0];\nawait device.openConnection();\nlet callback = await device.pair();\n// the pin is provided onscreen from the Apple TV\nawait callback(pin);\n// you're paired!\nlet credentials = device.credentials.toString();\nconsole.log(credentials);\n```\n\n#### Connect to a paired Apple TV\n\n```typescript\nimport { scan, parseCredentials, NowPlayingInfo } from 'node-appletv';\n\n// see example above for how to get the credentials string\nlet credentials = parseCredentials(credentialsString);\n\nlet devices = await scan(uniqueIdentifier)[]\nlet device = devices[0];\nawait device.openConnection(credentials);\n// you're connected!\n// press menu\nawait device.sendKeyCommand(AppleTV.Key.Menu);\nconsole.log(\"Sent a menu command!\");\n\n// monitor now playing info\ndevice.on('nowPlaying', (info: NowPlayingInfo) => {\n\tconsole.log(info.toString());\n});\n```\n\nThe `uniqueIdentifier` is advertised by each Apple TV via Bonjour. Use an app like [Bonjour Browser](http://www.tildesoft.com) to find it. The identifier is also the first value in the string value of the `Credentials` object.\n\nSee [homebridge-theater-mode](https://github.com/evandcoleman/homebridge-theater-mode) for a more practical use of this module.\n\n## Development\n\n`node-appletv` is written in Typescript. Edit files in the `src` directory and then run `npm link` to clean, build, and create the symlinks to use the library and cli.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n`node-appletv` would not have been possible without the work of these people:\n\n* [Jean Regisser](https://github.com/jeanregisser) who reversed the protobuf [spec of the MediaRemoteTV protocol](https://github.com/jeanregisser/mediaremotetv-protocol)\n* [Pierre St\u00e5hl](https://github.com/postlund) who [implemented the protocol in Python](https://github.com/postlund/pyatv)\n* [Khaos Tian](https://github.com/KhaosT) for [reversing the HomeKit protocol](https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS) which also uses SRP encryption\n* [Zach Bean](https://github.com/forty2) for [implementing the HAP client spec](https://github.com/forty2/hap-client)\n\n## Meta\n\nYou can find me on Twitter [@evandcoleman](https://twitter.com/evandcoleman)\n\nDistributed under the MIT license. See ``LICENSE`` for more information.\n\n[license-image]: https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg\n[license-url]: LICENSE"

  "readme_contents": "## [ApplePie](http://apppie.org)\n\nApplePie Toolkit is modular and responsive CSS framework. Getting started with ApplePie is easy. Whether you are building a simple   site with a 'default' UI, or you are a master of SASS, building a new app - this toolkit will help you get up and running!\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### CSS Version\nSimplest way to get started - straight CSS Toolkit version that includes everything you need to do rapid prototyping. Just grab a CSS file (applepie.css or applepie.min.css), include it to a web page and start doing markup without additional efforts on styling elements. Checkout [latest releases](https://github.com/alchapone/applepie/releases) to get started.\n\n### SASS Version\nYou'll need [node](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) to install it.\n\n#### Bower\n\n```\n  npm install -g bower\n  bower install applepie\n```\n\n\n#### Git\n\n```\n  git clone git@github.com:railsware/applepie.git\n  cd applepie\n  npm install -g grunt-cli   # if you haven't installed grunt previously\n  npm install\n  grunt build\n```\n\n#### Usage\nAll ApplePie SASS files should now be built into the ```dist/sass/``` directory. What you've\ngot here:\n\n```base/```: folder that contains all base layer styles like ```normalize.css```, ```grids.css``` etc.\n\n```mixins/```: contains all kinds of mixins that can be handy during development, like CSS3 mixins for\ndealing wit vendor prefixes, or responsive mixins for media queries.\n\n```components/```: is a folder that contains all UI components implemented also using SASS mixins.\nYou can use this default implementation of UI elements just by including components into your\nmain SASS file and using mixins inside selectors.\n\n```layout/```: layouts styles. [WIP]\n\n```applepie.sass```: linking all pie components together. If you want to use all ApplePie components -\njust include applepie.sass to your stylesheets.\n\n```manifest.sass```: this is sample applepie manifest, which has all selectors in place with use of components mixins.\nIf you want to feel all power of ApplePie's naming convention and want to use all benefits of\nstandardized naming, use ```manifest.sass``` as your main sass manifest file. Just copy this file to your\nstylesheets folder, include ```applepie.sass``` file at the top and you are ready to roll!\n\nFind out more at [apppie.org](http://apppie.org/pages/toolkit/getting_started.html)\n\n### Contributing\n\nSee the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/railsware/applepie/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for information on how to contribute to ApplePie Toolkit\n"

Either using the Unity Package Manager, or the traditional `.unitypackage` file.\n\n### Unity Package Manager\n\n#### Install via Git URL\n\nAvailable starting from Unity 2018.3.\n\nJust add this line to the `Packages/manifest.json` file of your Unity Project:\n\n```json\n\"dependencies\": {\n    \"com.lupidan.apple-signin-unity\": \"https://github.com/lupidan/apple-signin-unity.git#v1.4.2\",\n}\n```\n\n#### Install via OpenUPM\n\nThe package is available on the [openupm registry](https://openupm.com). You can install it via [openupm-cli](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli).\n\n```\nopenupm add com.lupidan.apple-signin-unity\n```\n\n### Unity Package File\n1. Download the most recent Unity package release [here](https://github.com/lupidan/apple-signin-unity/releases)\n2. Import the downloaded Unity package in your app. There are two main folders:\n\n* The `AppleAuth` folder contains the **main plugin**.\n* The `AppleAuthSample` folder contains **sample code** to use as a reference, or to test the plugin.\n\n![Import detail](./Img/ImportPlugin.png)\n\n## Plugin setup (iOS/tvOS)\n\nTo be able to use Apple's platform and framework for Authenticating with an Apple ID, we need to set up our Xcode project. Two different options are available to set up the entitlements required to enable Apple ID authentication with the iOS SDK.\n\n### Programmatic setup with a Script\n\n*RECOMMENDED*\n\nThis plugin **provides an extension method** for `ProjectCapabilityManager` ([docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/iOS.Xcode.ProjectCapabilityManager.html)), used to add this entitlement programatically after an Xcode build has finished.\n\nSimply create a Post Processing build script ([more info](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Callbacks.PostProcessBuildAttribute.html)) that performs the call. If you already have a post process build script, it should be simple to add to your code.\n\nThe provided extension method is `AddSignInWithAppleWithCompatibility`. It accepts an optional argument for Unity 2019.3 to indicate the UnityFramework target Guid.\n\nSample code:\n```csharp\nusing AppleAuth.Editor;\n\npublic static class SignInWithApplePostprocessor\n{\n    [PostProcessBuild(1)]\n    public static void OnPostProcessBuild(BuildTarget target, string path)\n    {\n        if (target != BuildTarget.iOS)\n            return;\n\n        var projectPath = PBXProject.GetPBXProjectPath(path);\n        \n        // Adds entitlement depending on the Unity version used\n#if UNITY_2019_3_OR_NEWER\n            var project = new PBXProject();\n            project.ReadFromString(System.IO.File.ReadAllText(projectPath));\n            var manager = new ProjectCapabilityManager(projectPath, \"Entitlements.entitlements\", null, project.GetUnityMainTargetGuid());\n            manager.AddSignInWithAppleWithCompatibility(project.GetUnityFrameworkTargetGuid());\n            manager.WriteToFile();\n#else\n            var manager = new ProjectCapabilityManager(projectPath, \"Entitlements.entitlements\", PBXProject.GetUnityTargetName());\n            manager.AddSignInWithAppleWithCompatibility();\n            manager.WriteToFile();\n#endif\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Manual entitlements setup\n\nThe other option is to manually setup all the entitlements in our Xcode project. Note that when making an iOS Build from Unity into the same folder, if you choose the option to overwrite, you will need to perform the Manual setup again.\n\n1. In your generated Xcode project. Select the main app Unity-iPhone target and select the option *Signing And Capabilities*. You should see there an option to add a capability from a list. Just locate *Sign In With Apple* and add it to your project.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <a href=\"./Img/AddEntitlements.png\"><img src=\"./Img/AddEntitlements.png\" alt=\"Add Entitlements\" width=\"400\"/></a>\n</p>\n\n\n2. This should have added an Entitlements file to your project. Locate it on the project explorer (it should be a file with the extension `.entitlements`). Inside it you should see an entry like this one:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <a href=\"./Img/EntitlementsDetail.png\"><img src=\"./Img/EntitlementsDetail.png\"/></a>\n</p>\n\n3. You need to import the `AuthenticationServices.framework` library in the Build Phases->Link Binary with Libraries. **If you are targeting older iOS versions**, mark the library as `Optional`.\n\n    For **Unity 2019.3** onwards, add it to the UnityFramework target\n\n    For **previous Unity versions**, add it to the main Unity-iPhone target\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <a href=\"./Img/AddFramework20193.png\"><img src=\"./Img/AddFramework20193.png\" alt=\"Add Framework 2019.3\" width=\"400\"/></a>\n    <a href=\"./Img/AddFrameworkPrevious.png\"><img src=\"./Img/AddFrameworkPrevious.png\" alt=\"Add Framework Previous versions\" width=\"400\"/></a>\n</p>\n\n### Enabling Apple capability\n\nYou will also need to **setup everything** in the Apple's developer portal. More information can be found [here](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/devde676e696). Please remember this plugin only supports native Sign In With Apple on iOS (no REST API support).\n\nThere is also a [Getting Started site](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/get-started/).\n\n### Final notes regarding setup\n\nThe `AuthenticationServices.framework` should be added as Optional, to support previous iOS versions, avoiding crashes at startup.\n\nThe provided extension method uses reflection to integrate with the current tools Unity provides. It has been tested with Unity 2018.x and 2019.x. But if it fails on your particular Unity version, feel free to open a issue, specifying the Unity version.\n\n## Plugin setup (macOS)\n\nAn unsigned precompiled `.bundle` file is available. The precompiled `.bundle` should support both architectures: Intel `x86_64` & Apple Silicon `arm64`(Experimental). The bundle should be automatically included in your macOS builds.\nHowever that `.bundle` needs to be modified to avoid issues when uploading it to the MacOS App Store.\n\nIn particular, the bundle identifier of that `.bundle` needs to be modified to a custom one.\n\nTo automate the process, there is a helper method that will change the bundle identifier to one based on your project's application identifier.\nYou should call this method on a Postprocess build script of your choice.\n\n```csharp\nusing AppleAuth.Editor;\n\npublic static class SignInWithApplePostprocessor\n{\n    [PostProcessBuild(1)]\n    public static void OnPostProcessBuild(BuildTarget target, string path)\n    {\n        if (target != BuildTarget.StandaloneOSX)\n            return;\n\n        AppleAuthMacosPostprocessorHelper.FixManagerBundleIdentifier(target, path);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe Xcode project with the source code to generate a new bundle file is available at `MacOSAppleAuthManager/MacOSAppleAuthManager.xcodeproj`\n\nTo support the feature, **the app needs to be codesigned correctly**, including the required entitlements. For more information regarding macOS codesign, please follow this [link](./docs/macOS_NOTES.md).\n\n## Implement Sign in With Apple\n\n> Currently, it seems Sign In With Apple does not work properly in the simulator. This needs testing on a device with an iOS 13 version.\n\nAn overall flow of how the native Sign In With Apple flow could work is presented in this diagram.\n\n![Frameworks detail](./Img/AppleSignInFlow_v3.png)\n\n### Initializing\n```csharp\nprivate IAppleAuthManager appleAuthManager;\n\nvoid Start()\n{\n    ...\n   // If the current platform is supported\n   if (AppleAuthManager.IsCurrentPlatformSupported)\n   {\n       // Creates a default JSON deserializer, to transform JSON Native responses to C# instances\n       var deserializer = new PayloadDeserializer();\n       // Creates an Apple Authentication manager with the deserializer\n       this.appleAuthManager = new AppleAuthManager(deserializer);    \n   }\n    ...\n}\n\nvoid Update()\n{\n    ...\n    // Updates the AppleAuthManager instance to execute\n    // pending callbacks inside Unity's execution loop\n    if (this.appleAuthManager != null)\n    {\n        this.appleAuthManager.Update();\n    }\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n### Perform Sign In With Apple\n\n> :warning: You will receive users's email and name **ONLY THE FIRST TIME THE USER LOGINS**. Any further login attempts **will have a NULL Email and FullName**, unless you [revoke the credentials](#how-can-i-logout-does-the-plugin-provide-any-logout-option)\n\nIf you want to Sign In and request the Email and Full Name for a user, you can do it like this:\n\n```csharp\nvar loginArgs = new AppleAuthLoginArgs(LoginOptions.IncludeEmail | LoginOptions.IncludeFullName);\n\nthis.appleAuthManager.LoginWithAppleId(\n    loginArgs,\n    credential =>\n    {\n        // Obtained credential, cast it to IAppleIDCredential\n        var appleIdCredential = credential as IAppleIDCredential;\n        if (appleIdCredential != null)\n        {\n            // Apple User ID\n            // You should save the user ID somewhere in the device\n            var userId = appleIdCredential.User;\n            PlayerPrefs.SetString(AppleUserIdKey, userId);\n\n            // Email (Received ONLY in the first login)\n            var email = appleIdCredential.Email;\n\n            // Full name (Received ONLY in the first login)\n            var fullName = appleIdCredential.FullName;\n\n            // Identity token\n            var identityToken = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(\n                appleIdCredential.IdentityToken,\n                0,\n                appleIdCredential.IdentityToken.Length);\n\n            // Authorization code\n            var authorizationCode = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(\n                appleIdCredential.AuthorizationCode,\n                0,\n                appleIdCredential.AuthorizationCode.Length);\n\n            // And now you have all the information to create/login a user in your system\n        }\n    },\n    error =>\n    {\n        // Something went wrong\n        var authorizationErrorCode = error.GetAuthorizationErrorCode();\n    });\n```\n\n### Quick login\n\nThis should be the **first thing to try** when the user first runs the application.\n\nIf the user has previously authorized the app to login with Apple, this will open a native dialog to re-confirm the login, and obtain an Apple User ID.\n\nIf the credentials were never given, or they were revoked, the Quick login will fail.\n\n![Frameworks detail](./Img/QuickLogin.png)\n\n```csharp\nvar quickLoginArgs = new AppleAuthQuickLoginArgs();\n\nthis.appleAuthManager.QuickLogin(\n    quickLoginArgs,\n    credential =>\n    {\n        // Received a valid credential!\n        // Try casting to IAppleIDCredential or IPasswordCredential\n\n        // Previous Apple sign in credential\n        var appleIdCredential = credential as IAppleIDCredential; \n\n        // Saved Keychain credential (read about Keychain Items)\n        var passwordCredential = credential as IPasswordCredential;\n    },\n    error =>\n    {\n        // Quick login failed. The user has never used Sign in With Apple on your app. Go to login screen\n    });\n```\n\nNote that, if this succeeds, you will **ONLY** receive the Apple User ID (no email or name, even if it was previously requested).\n\n#### IOS Keychain Support\nWhen performing a quick login, if the SDK detects [IOS Keychain credentials](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services/keychain_items?language=objc) for your app, it will return those.\n\nJust cast the credential to `IPasswordCredential` to get the login details for the user.\n\n### Checking credential status\n\nThis is used to verify that an Apple User ID is still valid.\n\nGiven an `userId` from a previous successful sign in.\nYou can check the credential state of that user ID like so:\n\n```csharp\nthis.appleAuthManager.GetCredentialState(\n    userId,\n    state =>\n    {\n        switch (state)\n        {\n            case CredentialState.Authorized:\n                // User ID is still valid. Login the user.\n                break;\n            \n            case CredentialState.Revoked:\n                // User ID was revoked. Go to login screen.\n                break;\n            \n            case CredentialState.NotFound:\n                // User ID was not found. Go to login screen.\n                break;\n        }\n    },\n    error =>\n    {\n        // Something went wrong\n    });\n```\n\n### Listening to credentials revoked notification\n\nIt may be that your user suddenly decides to revoke the authorization that was given previously. You should be able to listen to the incoming notification by registering a callback for it.\n\n\n```csharp\nthis.appleAuthManager.SetCredentialsRevokedCallback(result =>\n{\n    // Sign in with Apple Credentials were revoked.\n    // Discard credentials/user id and go to login screen.\n});\n```\n\nTo clear the callback, and stop listening to notifications, simply set it to `null`\n\n```csharp\nthis.appleAuthManager.SetCredentialsRevokedCallback(null);\n```\n\n### Nonce and State support for Authorization Requests\n\nBoth methods, `LoginWithAppleId` and `QuickLogin`, use a custom structure containing arguments for the authorization request.\n\nAn optional `Nonce` and an optional `State` can be set for both structures when constructing them:\n\n```csharp\n// Your custom Nonce string\nvar yourCustomNonce = \"RANDOM_NONCE_FORTHEAUTHORIZATIONREQUEST\";\nvar yourCustomState = \"RANDOM_STATE_FORTHEAUTHORIZATIONREQUEST\";\n\n// Arguments for a normal Sign In With Apple Request\nvar loginArgs = new AppleAuthLoginArgs(\n    LoginOptions.IncludeEmail | LoginOptions.IncludeFullName,\n    yourCustomNonce,\n    yourCustomState);\n\n// Arguments for a Quick Login\nvar quickLoginArgs = new AppleAuthQuickLoginArgs(yourCustomNonce, yourCustomState);\n```\n\nThe `State` is returned later in the received Apple ID credential, allowing you to validate that the request was generated in your device.\n\nThe `Nonce` is embedded in the IdentityToken, included in the received Apple ID credential. It is important to generate a new random `Nonce` for every request. This is useful for services that provide a built in solution for **Sign In With Apple**, like [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/apple?authuser=0)\n\nSome tentative guide is available for Firebase integration [here](./docs/Firebase_NOTES.md)\n\nMore info about State and Nonce can be found in [this WWDC 2020 session](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10173/) (check at 2m35s)\n\n## FAQ\n+ [Does it support landscape orientations](#does-it-support-landscape-orientations)\n+ [How can I Logout?

For more details, check this [issue](https://github.com/lupidan/apple-signin-unity/issues/5). \n\n### How can I Logout? Does the plugin provide any Logout option?\n\nOn **iOS 13**  Apple does not provide any method to *\"logout\"* programatically. If you want to *\"logout\"* and re-test account creation, you need to revoke the credentials through settings.\n\nGo to `Settings` => `Click your iTunes user` => `Password & Security` => `Apple ID logins`. There you can select the app and click on `Stop using Apple ID`.\n\nAfter this, the credentials are effectively revoked, your app will receive a [Credentials Revoked notification](#listening-to-credentials-revoked-notification). This will allow you to re-test account creation.\n\n### I am not getting a full name, or an email, even though I am requesting them in the LoginWithAppleId call\n\nThis probably means that you already used Sign In with apple at some point. Apple will give you the email/name **ONLY ONCE**. Once the credential is created, __it's your app/game's responsibility to send that information somewhere__, so an account is created with the given user identifier.\n\nIf a credential was already created, you will only receive a user identifier, so it will work similarly to a Quick Login.\n\nIf you want to test new account scenarios, you need to [revoke](#how-can-i-logout-does-the-plugin-provide-any-logout-option) your app credentials for that Apple ID through the settings menu.\n\n### Is it possible to NOT request the user's email or full name?\n\nYes, just provide `LoginOptions.None` when calling `LoginWithAppleId` and the user will not be asked for their email or full name.\nThis will skip that entire login step and make it more smooth. It is recommended if the user's email or full name is not used.\n\n```csharp\nappleAuthManager.LoginWithAppleId(LoginOptions.None, credential => { ... }, error => { ... });\n```\n\n### Does the plugin use UnitySendMessage?\n\nNo. The plugin uses callbacks in a static context with request identifiers using JSON strings. Callbacks are scheduled inside `AppleAuthManager`, and calling `Update` on it will execute those pending callbacks.\n\n### Why do I need to call Update manually on the AppleAuthManager instance?\n\nCallbacks from iOS SDK are executed in their own thread (normally the main thread), and outside Unity's engine control. Meaning that you can't update the UI, or worse, if your callback throws an Exception (like a simple NRE), it will crash the Game completely.\n\nIt's recommended to update the instance of `AppleAuthManager` regularly in a MonoBehaviour of your choice.\n\n### What deserialization library does it use by default?\n\nIf you initialize the `AppleAuthManager` with the built-in `PayloadDeserializer`, it uses Unity JSON serialization system, so **no extra libraries are added**.\n\nYou can also implement your own deserialization by implementing an `IPayloadDeserializer`.\n\n### Any way to get a refresh token on iOS to verify a user?\n\n**NO**, That's not how Apple wants you to do it. This is how they want you to verify a user:\n\n_On iOS:_ The first login gives you the Apple User ID and an Authorization Code to send to your backend. Checking the validity of a user on the device, from now on, should be done with `GetCredentialState` and that Apple User ID.\n\n_On the server:_ It receives the data from the first login on iOS to create the user. Uses that received Authorization Code to get a refresh token for the user. Refreshes the token once a day.\n[More info here](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple/sign_in_with_apple_rest_api/verifying_a_user)\n\n### I am getting a CFBundleIdentifier Collision error when uploading my app to the macOS App Store:\n\nIf you are experiencing an error like this when uploading your macOS app to the App Store\n> The info.plist CFBundleIdentifier value 'com.lupidan.MacOSAppleAuthManager\" of 'appname.app/Contents/Plugins/MacOSAppleAuthManager.bundle' is already in use by another application\"\n\nIt probably means that your [postprocess build script for macOS](#plugin-setup-macos) is not setup correctly.\n\nYou should call `AppleAuthMacosPostprocessorHelper.FixManagerBundleIdentifier` to fix the plugin's bundle identifier to a custom one for your app.\n\nYou can find more details about the bug [here](https://github.com/lupidan/apple-signin-unity/issues/72)\n\n"

That's where they'll get picked up by FastScripts, iTunes, and the various apps they're meant to interact with.\n\n# Libraries\n\nMany scripts use libraries I've written for certain common functions. Those are located in the `Scripts/Libraries` directory. To load them, you'll see code like the following:\n\n    property LibLoader : load script file ((path to scripts folder from user domain as text) & \"Libraries:Library Loader.scpt\")\n    property StringsLib : LibLoader's loadScript(\"Libraries:Strings.applescript\")\n\nThe first line creates a reference to the library responsible for loading the other ones. That script has to be a compiled scripts (with the `.scpt` extension), whereas all other scripts are in the plaintext `.applescript` format. I've committed the `Library Loader` script in both formats, so the plain-text version can be searched and diff'ed, but the compiled version can be loaded as a property. Each library script contains a comment at the top of the file, which can be copied and pasted into a script that wishes to refer to it.\n\nAny scripts loaded with `Library Loader` can be compiled or plain-text, and plain-text files can be encoded in Mac format (which AppleScript Editor uses) or UTF-8, but only in those two.\n\n# Tests\n\nI've got a basic suite of custom-built tests in `Scripts/Libraries/Library Tests.applescript`, which you can run, and observe its log output for failures. I plan to someday move it to [ASUnit](http://nirs.freeshell.org/asunit/) instead ([Issue #1](https://github.com/abbeycode/AppleScripts/issues/1)).\n\n# iTunes Script Menu\n\nSome iTunes scripts don't work from the Script Menu at all, such as [Re-import Lossless Tracks.applescript](https://github.com/abbeycode/AppleScripts/blob/master/iTunes/Scripts/Re-import%20Lossless%20Tracks.applescript), and others, such as [Upgrade Tracks.applescript](https://github.com/abbeycode/AppleScripts/blob/master/iTunes/Scripts/Upgrade%20Tracks.applescript) need to be compiled into `.scpt` format to work.\n\n# Automator Service Scripts\n\nSome scripts are intended to be run as Automator \"Run ApplesScript\" actions within a [service](http://www.macosxautomation.com/services/), though they don't provide much utility as a standalone script. These are in the [Services](https://github.com/abbeycode/AppleScripts/blob/master/Services) folder. You can use these in your own services by using the following text in the Automator workflow (as I described in [a blog post](http://dovfrankel.com/post/49510291962/running-applescripts-from-automator)):\n\n    on run {input, parameters}\n    \n        run script file \"<git checkout path>:AppleScripts:Services:Encode With HandBrake.applescript\" with parameters {input, parameters}\n    \n    end run\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThese scripts work for me, and I hope they will either work for you as-is, or at least lead you to a workable solution. Please review the scripts before you attempt to run them. I can't guarantee they don't have weird side effects I haven't encountered yet. If you do find issues, though, please send me a pull request and I'll try to incorporate any fixes you come up with."

  "readme_contents": "![GIOVANNI GAMEPLAY](gameplay.gif)\n![GIOVANNI](banner.png)\n\n**A Gameboy Emulator for the Apple Watch.**\n\n**Interested in how this was made? Check out the write-up [here](http://gabrieloc.com/2017/03/21/GIOVANNI.html)**\n\n## Installation\n\nGiovanni uses git submodules for it's one dependency, a modified version of the [Gambatte](https://github.com/gabrieloc/gambatte) emulator. When cloning, ensure submodules are also pulled down:\n\n``` bash\n$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:gabrieloc/GIOVANNI.git\n```\n\nTo run on your device:\n1. Make sure you have an Apple developer account\n2. Select your development team under the `Signing` area for each target (`giovanni_iOS`, `giovanni_watchOS`, `giovanni WatchKit Extension`, and `Gambatte_watchOS`)\n3. Change the `Bundle Identifier` for each of the above targets to something unique. For example, `giovanni_iOS` uses `com.gabrieloc.giovanni`, so change that to something like `com.YOUR_USERNAME.giovanni`.\n4. Select the `giovanni` scheme in the top left corner with your device selected and run.\n\nIf you are still having issues, please following the tutorial provided by [Redmond Pie](http://www.redmondpie.com/install-giovanni-game-boy-emulator-on-apple-watch-heres-how-tutorial/)\n\n## Usage\n\nGames are loaded from your iPhone's documents directory. In iTunes, drop `.gb` or `.gbc` files into the Giovanni app documents folder, and they'll show up automatically on your Apple Watch. When you play a game for the first time, it'll download to your watch and get cached in the watch's documents directory. Subsequent loads are immediate.\n\nUPDATE: Giovanni can open ROMs natively, allowing you to bypass iTunes entirely. [More info](https://github.com/gabrieloc/GIOVANNI/pull/9).\n\nEmulator saving and loading is automatic, and happens whenever the app gets closed/inactivated or opened/activated. In-game saving and loading is completely separate. If for some reason the emulator save gets corrupted, force-touching the screen will bring up the option to reset the emulator, allowing you to resume from your in-game save.\n\nThe control scheme is as follows:\n\n![Controls](controls.png)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nDisclaimer: Due to the constraints of watchOS, you may experience crashes or graphical glitches. Keep in mind that this project likely does not align with what Apple expects from the platform, which in turn makes it difficult to optimize and debug.\n\nIf for some reason the app becomes unresponsive and must be force-quit, you can do so by having the app in the foreground, pressing the side button, then pressing and holding the Digital Crown for about 5 seconds.\n\n### Games don't show up\nBecause Giovanni relies on your iPhone for transferring games, ensure your paired iPhone is on and within reach.\n\n### Garbled (or all white) pixels\nVideo memory often gets corrupt, in which case you will have to force emulation to be reset. While in-game, force touch the screen and select Reset. If the app closes after that, you will have to re-open, and repeat the process until it works.\n\n### Colors wrong\nSome games appear to format pixel data differently. The rendering work is done in [GameCoreSnapshots.swift](https://github.com/gabrieloc/GIOVANNI/blob/master/gambatte_watchOS/GameCoreSnapshots.swift), you may have luck adjusting how the Core Graphics context is created.\n\n## Known Issues\n\n### Games sometime crash when trying to fill the sound buffer\nThe sound buffer isn't even used, but required by Gambatte. The issue goes away after re-opening the app, but is a huge pain regardless.\n"

NWPusher has a modular architecture and does not have any external dependencies, so use what you like.\n\n\nAbout\n-----\nTesting push notifications for your iOS or Mac app can be a pain. You might consider setting up your own server or use one of the many push webservices online. Either way it's a lot of work to get all these systems connected properly. When it is all working properly, push notifications come in fast (< 1 sec) and reliably. However when nothing comes in, it can be very hard to find out why.\n\nThat's why I made *Pusher*. It is a Mac and iPhone app for sending push notifications *directly* to the *Apple Push Notification Service*. No need to set up a server or create an account online. You only need the SSL certificate and a device token to start pushing directly from your Mac, or even from an iPhone! Pusher has detailed error reporting and logs, which are very helpful with verifying your setup.\n\nPusher comes with a small framework for both OS X and iOS. It provides various tools for sending notifications programmatically. On OS X it can use the keychain to retrieve push certificates and keys. Pusher can also be used without keychain, using a PKCS #12 file. If you want to get a better understanding of how push notifications work, then this framework is a good place to start and play around.\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\nMac OS X application for sending push notifications through the APN service:\n- Takes *certificates and keys* directly from the *keychain*\n- Fully customizable *payload* with *syntax checking*\n- Allows setting *expiration* and *priority*\n- *Stores device tokens* so you don't have to copy-paste them every time\n- Handles *PKCS #12* files (.p12)\n- Automatic configuration for *sandbox*\n- Reports *detailed error messages* returned by APNs\n- Reads from *feedback service*\n\nOS X and iOS framework for sending pushes from your own application:\n- Modular, no dependencies, use what you like\n- Fully documented source code\n- Detailed error handling\n- iOS compatible, so you can also push directly from your iPhone :o\n- Demo applications for both platforms\n\n\nGetting started\n---------------\nBefore you can start sending push notification payloads, there are a few hurdles to take. First you'll need to obtain the *Apple Push Services SSL Certificate* of the app you want to send notifications to. This certificate is used by Pusher to set up the SSL connection through which the payloads will be sent to Apple.\n\nSecond you'll need the *device token* of the device you want to send your payload to. Every device has its own unique token that can only be obtained from within the app. It's a bit complicated, but in the end it all comes down to just a few clicks on Apple's Dev Center website, some gray hairs, and a bit of patience.\n\n### Certificate\nLet's start with the SSL certificate. The goal is to get both the certificate *and* the private key into your OS X keychain. If someone else already generated this certificate, you'll need to ask for exporting these into a PKCS12 file. If there is no certificate generated yet, you can generate the certificate and the private key in the following steps:\n\n1. Log in to [Apple's Dev Center](https://developer.apple.com)\n2. Go to the *Provisioning Portal* or *Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles*\n3. Go to *Certificates* and create a *Apple Push Notification service SSL*\n4. From here on you will be guided through the certificate generation process.\n\nKeep in mind that you will eventually be downloading a certificate, which you will need to install in your keychain together with the private key. This should look something like this:\n\n<img src=\"Docs/keychain1.png\" alt=\"Keychain export\" width=\"690\"/>\n\nNB: There is `Development` and `Production` certificates, which should (generally) correspond to respectively `DEBUG` and `RELEASE` versions of your app. Make sure you get the right one, check *Development (sandbox) or Production*, *iOS or Mac*, and the *bundle identifier*.\n\nThe push certificate should be exported to a PKCS12 file, which allows you to share these with fellow developers:\n\n<img src=\"Docs/keychain2.png\" alt=\"PKCS12 file\" width=\"690\"/>\n\n### Device token\nNow you need to obtain a device token, which is a 64 character hex string (256 bits). This should be done from within the iOS app you're going to push to. Add the following lines to the application delegate (Xcode 6 required):\n\n```objective-c\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application\n    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions\n{\n    if ([application respondsToSelector:@selector(registerUserNotificationSettings:)]) {\n        NSLog(@\"Requesting permission for push notifications...\"); // iOS 8\n        UIUserNotificationSettings *settings = [UIUserNotificationSettings settingsForTypes:\n            UIUserNotificationTypeAlert | UIUserNotificationTypeBadge |\n            UIUserNotificationTypeSound categories:nil];\n        [UIApplication.sharedApplication registerUserNotificationSettings:settings];\n    } else {\n        NSLog(@\"Registering device for push notifications...\"); // iOS 7 and earlier\n        [UIApplication.sharedApplication registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:\n            UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert | UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge |\n            UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound];\n    }\n    return YES;\n}\n\n- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application\n    didRegisterUserNotificationSettings:(UIUserNotificationSettings *)settings\n{\n    NSLog(@\"Registering device for push notifications...\"); // iOS 8\n    [application registerForRemoteNotifications];\n}\n\n- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application\n    didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)token\n{\n    NSLog(@\"Registration successful, bundle identifier: %@, mode: %@, device token: %@\",\n        [NSBundle.mainBundle bundleIdentifier], [self modeString], token);\n}\n\n- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application\n    didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError *)error\n{\n    NSLog(@\"Failed to register: %@\", error);\n}\n\n- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application handleActionWithIdentifier:(NSString *)identifier\n    forRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)notification completionHandler:(void(^)())completionHandler\n{\n    NSLog(@\"Received push notification: %@, identifier: %@\", notification, identifier); // iOS 8\n    completionHandler();\n}\n\n- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application\n    didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)notification\n{\n    NSLog(@\"Received push notification: %@\", notification); // iOS 7 and earlier\n}\n\n- (NSString *)modeString\n{\n#if DEBUG\n    return @\"Development (sandbox)\";\n#else\n    return @\"Production\";\n#endif\n}\n```\n\nNow, when you run the application, the 64 character push string will be logged to the console.\n\n### Push from OS X\nWith the SSL certificate and private key in the keychain and the device token on the pasteboard, you're ready to send some push notifications. Let's start by sending a notification using the *Pusher app for Mac OS X*. Open the Pusher Xcode project and run the PusherMac target:\n\n<img src=\"Docs/osx1.png\" alt=\"Pusher OS X\" width=\"612\"/>\n\nThe combo box at the top lists the available SSL certificates in the keychain. Select the certificate you want to use and paste the device token of the device you're pushing to. The text field below shows the JSON formatted payload text that you're sending. Read more about this format in the Apple documentation under *Apple Push Notification Service*.\n\nNow before you press *Push*, make sure the application you're *sending to* is in the *background*, e.g. by pressing the home button. This way you're sure the app is not going to interfere with the message, yet. Press push, wait a few seconds, and see the notification coming in.\n\nIf things are not working as expected, then take a look at the *Troubleshooting* section below.\n\n<img src=\"Docs/osx2.png\" alt=\"Pusher OS X\" width=\"612\"/>\n\n### Push from iOS\nThe ultimate experience is of course pushing from an iPhone to an iPhone, directly. This can be done with the Pusher iOS app. Before you run the PusherTouch target, make sure to include the *certificate, private key, and device token* inside the app. Take the PKCS12 file that you exported earlier and include it in the PusherTouch bundle. Then go to `NWAppDelegate.m` in the `Touch` folder and configure `pkcs12FileName`, `pkcs12Password`, and `deviceToken`. Now run the PusherTouch target:\n\n<img src=\"Docs/ios.png\" alt=\"Pusher iOS\" width=\"414\"/>\n\nIf everything is set up correctly, you only need to *Connect* and *Push*. Then you should receive the `Testing..` push message on the device.\n\nAgain, if things are not working as expected, take a look at the *Troubleshooting* section below or post an issue on GitHub.\n\nConsult Apple's documentation for more info on the APNs architecture: [Apple Push Notification Service](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/ApplePushService.html)\n\nPushing from code\n-----------------\nPusher can also be used as a framework to send notifications programmatically. The included Xcode project provides examples for both OS X and iOS. The easiest way to include NWPusher is through CocoaPods:\n\n```ruby\npod 'NWPusher', '~> 0.7.0'\n```\n\nCocoaPods also compiles documentation, which can be accessed through [CocoaDocs](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/NWPusher). Alternatively you can include just the files you need from the `Classes` folder. Make sure you link with `Foundation.framework` and `Security.framework`.\n\nBefore any notification can be sent, you first need to create a connection. When this connection is established, any number of payloads can be sent.\n\n*Note that Apple doesn't like it when you create a connection for every push.* Therefore be careful to reuse a connection as much as possible in order to prevent Apple from blocking.\n\nTo create a connection directly from a PKCS12 (.p12) file:\n\n```objective-c\n    NSURL *url = [NSBundle.mainBundle URLForResource:@\"pusher.p12\" withExtension:nil];\n    NSData *pkcs12 = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:url];\n    NSError *error = nil;\n    NWPusher *pusher = [NWPusher connectWithPKCS12Data:pkcs12 password:@\"pa$$word\" error:&error];\n    if (pusher) {\n        NSLog(@\"Connected to APNs\");\n    } else {\n        NSLog(@\"Unable to connect: %@\", error);\n    }\n```\n\nWhen pusher is successfully connected, send a payload to your device:\n\n```objective-c\n    NSString *payload = @\"{\\\"aps\\\":{\\\"alert\\\":\\\"Testing..\\\"}}\";\n    NSString *token = @\"0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF\";\n    NSError *error = nil;\n    BOOL pushed = [pusher pushPayload:payload token:token identifier:rand() error:&error];\n    if (pushed) {\n        NSLog(@\"Pushed to APNs\");\n    } else {\n        NSLog(@\"Unable to push: %@\", error);\n    }\n```\n\nAfter a second or so, we can take a look to see if the notification was accepted by Apple:\n\n```objective-c\n    NSUInteger identifier = 0;\n    NSError *apnError = nil;\n    NSError *error = nil;\n    BOOL read = [pusher readFailedIdentifier:&identifier apnError:&apnError error:&error];\n    if (read && apnError) {\n        NSLog(@\"Notification with identifier %i rejected: %@\", (int)identifier, apnError);\n    } else if (read) {\n        NSLog(@\"Read and none failed\");\n    } else {\n        NSLog(@\"Unable to read: %@\", error);\n    }\n```\n\nAlternatively on OS X you can also use the keychain to obtain the SSL certificate. In that case first collect all certificates:\n\n```objective-c\n    NSError *error = nil;\n    NSArray *certificates = [NWSecTools keychainCertificatesWithError:&error];\n    if (certificates) {\n        NSLog(@\"Loaded %i certificates\", (int)certificates.count);\n    } else {\n        NSLog(@\"Unable to access keychain: %@\", error);\n    }\n```\n\nAfter selecting the right certificate, obtain the identity from the keychain:\n\n```objective-c\n    NSError *error = nil;\n    NWIdentityRef identity = [NWSecTools keychainIdentityWithCertificate:certificate error:&error];\n    if (identity) {\n        NSLog(@\"Loaded identity: %@\", [NWSecTools inspectIdentity:identity]);\n    } else {\n        NSLog(@\"Unable to create identity: %@\", error);\n    }\n```\n\nTake a look at the example project for variations on this approach.\n\nConsult Apple's documentation for more info on the client-server communication: [Provider Communication](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/CommunicatingWIthAPS.html)\n\nFeedback Service\n----------------\nThe feedback service is part of the Apple Push Notification service. The feedback service is basically a list containing device tokens that became invalid. Apple recommends that you read from the feedback service once every 24 hours, and no longer send notifications to listed devices. Note that this can be used to find out who removed your app from their device.\n\nCommunication with the feedback service can be done with the `NWPushFeedback` class. First connect using one of the `connect` methods:\n\n```objective-c\n    NSURL *url = [NSBundle.mainBundle URLForResource:@\"pusher.p12\" withExtension:nil];\n    NSData *pkcs12 = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:url];\n    NSError *error = nil;\n    NWPushFeedback *feedback = [NWPushFeedback connectWithPKCS12Data:pkcs12 password:@\"pa$$word\" error:&error];\n    if (feedback) {\n        NSLog(@\"Connected to feedback service\");\n    } else {\n        NSLog(@\"Unable to connect to feedback service: %@\", error);\n    }\n```\n\nWhen connected read the device token and date of invalidation:\n\n```objective-c\n    NSError *error = nil;\n    NSArray *pairs = [feedback readTokenDatePairsWithMax:100 error:&error];\n    if (pairs) {\n        NSLog(@\"Read token-date pairs: %@\", pairs);\n    } else {\n        NSLog(@\"Unable to read feedback: %@\", error);\n    }\n```\n\nApple closes the connection after the last device token is read.\n\nPushing to macOS\n---------------\n\nOn macOS, you obtain a device token for your app by calling the `registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:` method of the `NSApplication` object. It is recommended that you call this method at launch time as part of your normal startup sequence. The first time your app calls this method, the app object requests the token from APNs. After the initial call, the app object contacts APNs only when the device token changes; otherwise, it returns the existing token quickly.\n\nThe app object notifies its delegate asynchronously upon the successful or unsuccessful retrieval of the device token. You use these delegate callbacks to process the device token or to handle any errors that arose. You must implement the following delegate methods to track whether registration was successful:\n\n- Use the `application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:` to receive the device token and forward it to your server.\n- Use the `application:didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:` to respond to errors.\n\nNote: If the device token changes while your app is running, the app object calls the appropriate delegate method again to notify you of the change.\n\nThe app delegate calls the `registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:` method as part of its regular launch-time setup, passing along the types of interactions that you intend to use. Upon receiving the device token, the `application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:` method forwards it to the app\u2019s associated server using a custom method. If an error occurs during registration, the app temporarily disables any features related to remote notifications. Those features are re-enabled when a valid device token is received.\n\n```objective-c\n    - (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(NSNotification *)notification {\n        // Configure the user interactions first.\n        [self configureUserInteractions];\n\n        [NSApp registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:(NSRemoteNotificationTypeAlert | NSRemoteNotificationTypeSound)];\n    }\n```\n\n```objective-c\n    - (void)application:(NSApplication *)application\n        didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {\n        // Forward the token to your server.\n        [self forwardTokenToServer:deviceToken];\n    }\n```\n\n```objective-c\n    - (void)application:(NSApplication *)application\n        didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError *)error {\n        NSLog(@\"Remote notification support is unavailable due to error: %@\", error);\n        [self disableRemoteNotificationFeatures];\n    }\n```\n\n\nCertificate and key files\n-------------------------\nPusher reads certificate and key data from PKCS12 files. This is a binary format that bundles both X.509 certificates and a private key in one file. Conversion from other file formats to and from PKCS12 is provided by the OpenSSL CLI.\n\n*Inspect PKCS12:*\n\n    openssl pkcs12 -in pusher.p12\n\nwhere the output should be something like:\n\n    ...\n    friendlyName: Apple Development/Production IOS/Mac Push Services: <your-bundle-identifier>\n    localKeyID: <key-id>\n    ...\n    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n    ...\n    friendlyName: <private-key-used-for-generating-above-certificate>\n    localKeyID: <same-key-id>\n    ...\n    -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n    ...\n\nMake sure your build matches the `Development/Production`, `iOS/Mac`, and bundle identifier.\n\n*Inspect PKCS12 structure:*\n\n    openssl pkcs12 -in pusher.p12 -info -noout\n\n*Inspect PEM:*\n\n    openssl rsa -in pusher.pem -noout -check\n    openssl rsa -in pusher.pem -pubout\n    openssl x509 -in pusher.pem -noout -pubkey\n\n*PKCS12 to PEM:*\n\n    openssl pkcs12 -in pusher.p12 -out pusher.pem -clcerts -aes256\n\nAlternatively you can use the command below, which does *not* encrypt the private key (not recommended):\n\n    openssl pkcs12 -in pusher.p12 -out pusher.pem -nodes -clcerts\n\n*PEM to PKCS12:*\n\n    openssl pkcs12 -export -in pusher.pem -out pusher.p12\n\nConsult the OpenSSL documentation for more details: [OpenSSL Documents - pkcs12](https://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/pkcs12.html)\n\nTroubleshooting\n---------------\nApple's Push Notification Service is not very forgiving in nature. If things are done in the wrong order or data is formatted incorrectly the service will refuse to deliver any notification, but generally provides few clues about went wrong and how to fix it. In the worst case, it simply disconnects without even notifying the client.\n\nSome tips on what to look out for:\n\n- A device token is unique to both the device, the developer's certificate, and to whether the app was built with a production or development (sandbox) certificate. Therefore make sure that the push certificate matches the app's provisioning profile exactly. This doesn't mean the tokens are always different; device tokens can be the same for different bundle identifiers.\n\n- There are two channels through which Apple responds to pushed notifications: the notification connection and the feedback connection. Both operate asynchronously, so for example after the second push has been sent, we might get a response to the first push, saying it has an invalid payload. Use a new identifier for every notification so these responses can be linked to the right notification.\n\nIf it fails to connect then check:\n\n- Are the certificates and keys in order? Use the OpenSSL commands listed above to inspect the certificate. See if there is one push certificate and key present. Also make sure you're online, try `ping www.apple.com`.\n\n- Is the certificate properly loaded? Try initializing an identity using `[NWSecTools identityWithPKCS12Data:data password:password error:&error]` or `[NWSecTools keychainIdentityWithCertificate:certificate error:&error]`.\n\n- Are you using the right identity? Use `[NWSecTools inspectIdentity:identity]` to inspect the identity instance. In general `NWSecTools` can be helpful for inspecting certificates, identities and the keychain.\n\n- Can you connect with the push servers? Try `[NWPusher connectWithIdentity:identity error:&error]` or `[NWPusher connectWithPKCS12Data:pkcs12 password:password error:&error]`.\n\n- Pusher connects on port `2195` with hosts `gateway.push.apple.com` and `gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com`, and on port `2196` with hosts `feedback.push.apple.com` and `feedback.sandbox.push.apple.com`. Make sure your firewall is configured to allow these connections.\n\nIf nothing is delivered to the device then check:\n\n- Is the device online? Is it able to receive push notifications from other services? Try to get pushes from other apps, for example a messenger. Many wireless connections work visibly fine, but do not deliver push notifications. Try to switch to another wifi or cellular network.\n\n- Are you pushing to the right device token? This token should be returned by the OS of the receiving device, in the callback `-application: didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:`. The push certificate should match the provisioning profile of the app, check *Development or Production*, *iOS or Mac*, and the *bundle identifier*. Make sure the receiving app is closed, so it cannot interfere with the delivery.\n\n- Does the push call succeed? Isn't there any negative response from the push server or feedback server? Both `[pusher pushPayload:payload token:token identifier:rand() error:&error]` and `[pusher readFailedIdentifier:&identifier apnError:&apnError error:&error]` should return `YES`, but wait a second between pushing and reading. Also try to connect to the feedback service to read feedback.\n\nConsult Apple's documentation for more troubleshooting tips: [Troubleshooting Push Notifications](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn2265/_index.html)\n\nBuild with Xcode\n----------------\nThe source comes with an Xcode project file that should take care of building the OS X and iOS demo applications. Alternatively you can also build `Pusher.app` from the commandline with `xcodebuild`:\n\n    xcodebuild -project NWPusher.xcodeproj -target PusherMac -configuration Release clean install\n\nAfter a successful build, `Pusher.app` can be found in the `build` folder of the project.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\nDocumentation generated and installed using *appledoc* by running from the project root:\n\n    appledoc .\n\nSee the [appledoc documentation](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/) for more info.\n\nLicense\n-------\nPusher is licensed under the terms of the BSD 2-Clause License, see the included LICENSE file.\n\n\nAuthors\n-------\n- [Noodlewerk](http://www.noodlewerk.com/)\n- [Leonard van Driel](http://www.leonardvandriel.nl/)\n"

Lower versions may compile with errors.\n\nFor ESP32, see [Arduino-HomeKit-ESP32](https://github.com/Mixiaoxiao/Arduino-HomeKit-ESP32). The HomeKit running on ESP32 has a **GREAT PERFORMANCE** which is 10x faster than ESP8266.\n\n## Preview\n\n![Preview](https://raw.github.com/Mixiaoxiao/Arduino-HomeKit-ESP8266/master/extras/preview.jpg) \n\n\n## Setup code of the example sketch\n\n``111-11-111``\n\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Define your accessory in a .c file to enjoy the  convenient \"Macro\" style declaration. You can also define your accessory in a .ino file using C++ code.\n\t```C\n\t\thomekit_accessory_t *accessories[] = ...\n\t\thomekit_server_config_t config = {\n\t\t\t.accessories = accessories,\n\t\t\t.password = \"111-11-111\",\n\t\t\t//.on_event = on_homekit_event, //optional\n\t\t\t//.setupId = \"ABCD\" //optional\n\t\t};\n\t```\n2. In your sketch\n\t```C\n\t\t#include <arduino_homekit_server.h>;\n\t\t\n\t\t//access the config defined in C code\n\t\textern \"C\" homekit_server_config_t config; \n\t\t\n\t\tvoid setup() {\n\t\t\tWiFi.begin(ssid, password);\n\t\t\tarduino_homekit_setup(&config);\n\t\t}\n\t\t\n\t\tvoid loop() {\n\t\t\tarduino_homekit_loop();\n\t\t}\n\t```\nDone.\n\n## Performance\n\nNotice: You should set the ESP8266 CPU to run at 160MHz (at least during the pairing process), to avoid the tcp-socket disconnection from iOS device caused by timeout.\n\n* Preinit: ~9.1s (You can see the accessory on your iOS HOME app after Preinit)\n* Pair Setup Step 1/3: ~0s (The heavy crypto computation is done in Preinit)\n* Pair Setup Step 2/3: ~12.1s \n* Pair Setup Step 3/3: ~0.8s  (The pair-setup is only processed when first paired with iOS device)\n* Pair Verify Step 1/2: ~0.3s\n* Pair Verify Step 2/2: ~0.8s (The Verify Step is required every time iOS connects or reconnects to ESP8266 to establish secure session)\n\nAll pairing process takes ~14s after you input the setup-code on your iPhone. Notice that Preinit require ~9s before you can start to pair.\n\n\n## Heap (memory)\n\nThe heap is critical for ESP8266 with full TCP/IP support. ESP8266 easily crashes when the memory is lower than ~5000.\n\nI tried to make WolfSSL crypto work safely on ESP8266 with better performance and lower memory or a trade-off. See details in next section.\n\nHere are the free heap values of running the example sketch:\n\n* Boot: ~26000\n* Preinit over: ~22000\n* Pairing: ~17000 (or even low when crypto computing)\n* Paired and connected with one iOS device: ~21700\n* Paired and no iOS device connected: ~23400\n\nAfter memory optimization in v1.1.0:\n\n* Boot: ~46000\n* Preinit over: ~41000\n* Pairing: ~37000 (or even low when crypto computing)\n* Paired and connected with one iOS device: ~41700\n* Paired and no iOS device connected: ~43000\n\n\n## WolfSSL\n\n* Based on wolfssl-3.13.0-stable.\n* Clean source code: the unused files are removed.\n* `CURVE25519_SMALL` and `ED25519_SMALL`: ESP8266 can not directly run without `SMALL` defined since the memory is not sufficient. But the NO `SMALL` version is faster. I mark the big `ge_precomp base[32][8]` with PROGMEM to store it in Flash (around 70KB). Also the `ge_double_scalarmult_vartime` can not run caused by lack of heap. I define `ESP_GE_DOUBLE_SCALARMULT_VARTIME_LOWMEM` in `user_settings.h` to use LOWMEM version of `ge_double_scalarmult_vartime` in `ge_low_mem.c`. This is a trade-off of performance and memory. If you want more Flash space, you should define `CURVE25519_SMALL` and `ED25519_SMALL` and undefine `ESP_GE_DOUBLE_SCALARMULT_VARTIME_LOWMEM` in `user_settings.h` (this will lead the Pair Verify Steps to take 1.2s + 0.9s).\n* `integer.c`(big integer operations): `MP_16BIT` and `ESP_FORCE_S_MP_EXPTMOD` are defined for better performance in ESP8266. `ESP_INTEGER_WINSIZE` (value is 3) is defined to avoid crash caused by memory exhaust and the values of {3, 4, 5} are of similar performance.\n\n## Storage\n\n* The pairing data is stored in the `EEPROM` address in ESP8266 Arduino core.\n* This project does not use the `EEPROM` library with data-cache to reduce memory use (directly call flash_read and write). \n* The `EEPROM` is 4096B in ESP8266, this project uses max [0, 1408B).\n* See the comments in `storge.c` and [ESP8266-EEPROM-doc](https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/2.6.3/libraries.html#eeprom).\n* `EEPROM` of [1408, 4096) is safe for you to use. \n* This project do NOT use `FS(file system)`, so you can use `FS` freely.\n\n\n## WatchDog\n\n* There are software and hardware watchdogs in ESP8266 Arduino core. The heavy crypto computing will lead to watchdog reset.\n* There are disable/enable api of software-watchdog in ESP8266 Arduino core.\n* I found the [esp_hw_wdt](https://github.com/ComSuite/esp_hw_wdt) to disable/enable the hardware-watchdog.\n* The two watchdogs are disabled while `Preinit` and `Pair Setup Step 2/3`.\n\n## Recommended settings in IDE\n\n* Module: Generic ESP8266 Module (to enable full settings)\n* FlashSize: at least 470KB for sketch (see `WolfSSL` section if you want a smaller sketch) \n* LwIP Variant: v2 Lower Memory (for lower memory use)\n* Debug Level: None (for lower memory use)\n* Espressif FW: nonos-sdk 2.2.1+119(191122) (which I used to build this project)\n* SSL Support: Basic SSL ciphers (lower ROM use)\n* VTables: Flash (does not matter maybe)\n* Erase Flash: select `All Flash Contents` when you first upload\n* CPU Frequency: 160MHz (must)\n\n## Arduino port\n\n* `ESP8266WiFi` (WiFiServer and WiFiClient) is used for tcp connection.\n* `ESP8266mDNS` is used for advertising (Bonjour) \n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n* Check your serial output with [example_serial_output.txt](https://raw.github.com/Mixiaoxiao/Arduino-HomeKit-ESP8266/master/extras/example_serial_output_v1.1.0.txt)\n\n\n## Change Log\n\n#### v1.4.0\n\n* Add `yield()` while crypto computing, to prevent WiFi disconnection. The idea is from [BbIKTOP-issues80](https://github.com/Yurik72/ESPHap/issues/80#issuecomment-803685175)\n* One new example.\n\n#### v1.3.0\n\n* Small improvements.\n\n#### v1.2.0\n\n* New examples.\n\n#### v1.1.0\n\n* Memory optimization: moved String/byte constants as much as possible to Flash. The `RODATA` section of `bin` is only 4672. Extra ~20K free-heap is available compared with v1.0.1.\n* Upload [ESP8266WiFi_nossl_noleak](https://github.com/Mixiaoxiao/Arduino-HomeKit-ESP8266/tree/master/extras/ESP8266WiFi_nossl_noleak/), a `nossl` and `noleak` version of the official `ESP8266WiFi` library of Arduino Core 2.6.3. Removed all codes of `SSL` to save memory (extra ~3K) since the HomeKit does not require SSL. Fix the memory-leak in `WiFiClinet.stop()` by adding `tcp_abandon(_pcb, 0)` in `stop()`, based on the idea of [esp8266/Arduino/pull/2767](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/pull/2767).\n\n#### v1.0.1 \n* Reduce `winsize` from `3` to `2`(same performance) to lower the heap required. Pairing can be done with low free-heap of ~14000.\n* Specify the MDNS runs on the IPAddress of STA to ensure the HomeKit can work with some SoftAP-based WiFi-Config libraries.\n* Rename the `HTTP_METHOD`(s) in `http_parser.h` to avoid multi-definition errors when using `ESP8266WebServer` together.\n\n## Thanks\n* [esp-homekit](https://github.com/maximkulkin/esp-homekit)\n* [esp-homekit-demo](https://github.com/maximkulkin/esp-homekit-demo)\n* [esp_hw_wdt](https://github.com/ComSuite/esp_hw_wdt)\n* [WolfSSL/WolfCrypt](https://www.wolfssl.com/products/wolfcrypt-2/)\n* [cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON)\n* [cQueue](https://github.com/SMFSW/cQueue)\n\n"

  "repo": "passepartoutvpn/tunnelkit",
  "language": "Swift",
  "readme_contents": "![iOS 13+](https://img.shields.io/badge/ios-13+-green.svg)\n![macOS 10.15+](https://img.shields.io/badge/macos-10.15+-green.svg)\n[![License GPLv3](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPLv3-lightgray.svg)](LICENSE)\n\n[![Unit Tests](https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/tunnelkit/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/tunnelkit/actions/workflows/test.yml)\n[![Release](https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/tunnelkit/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/tunnelkit/actions/workflows/release.yml)\n\n# TunnelKit\n\nThis library provides a generic framework for VPN development on Apple platforms.\n\n## OpenVPN\n\nTunnelKit comes with a simplified Swift/Obj-C implementation of the [OpenVPN\u00ae][dep-openvpn] protocol, whose crypto layer is built on top of [OpenSSL 1.1.1][dep-openssl].\n\nThe client is known to work with OpenVPN\u00ae 2.3+ servers.\n\n- [x] Handshake and tunneling over UDP or TCP\n- [x] Ciphers\n    - AES-CBC (128/192/256 bit)\n    - AES-GCM (128/192/256 bit, 2.4)\n- [x] HMAC digests\n    - SHA-1\n    - SHA-2 (224/256/384/512 bit)\n- [x] NCP (Negotiable Crypto Parameters, 2.4)\n    - Server-side\n- [x] TLS handshake\n    - Server validation (CA, EKU)\n    - Client certificate\n- [x] TLS wrapping\n    - Authentication (`--tls-auth`)\n    - Encryption (`--tls-crypt`)\n- [x] Compression framing\n    - Via `--comp-lzo` (deprecated in 2.4)\n    - Via `--compress`\n- [x] Compression algorithms\n    - LZO (via `--comp-lzo` or `--compress lzo`)\n- [x] Key renegotiation\n- [x] Replay protection (hardcoded window)\n\nThe library therefore supports compression framing, just not newer compression. Remember to match server-side compression and framing, otherwise the client will shut down with an error. E.g. if server has `comp-lzo no`, client must use `compressionFraming = .compLZO`.\n\n### Support for .ovpn configuration\n\nTunnelKit can parse .ovpn configuration files. Below are a few details worth mentioning.\n\n#### Non-standard\n\n- Single-byte XOR masking\n    - Via `--scramble xormask <character>`\n    - XOR all incoming and outgoing bytes by the ASCII value of the character argument\n    - See [Tunnelblick website][about-tunnelblick-xor] for more details\n\n#### Unsupported\n\n- UDP fragmentation, i.e. `--fragment`\n- Compression via `--compress` other than empty or `lzo`\n- Connecting via proxy\n- External file references (inline `<block>` only)\n- Static key encryption (non-TLS)\n- `<connection>` blocks\n- `vpn_gateway` and `net_gateway` literals in routes\n\n#### Ignored\n\n- Some MTU overrides\n    - `--link-mtu` and variants\n    - `--mssfix`\n- Multiple `--remote` with different `host` values (first wins)\n- Static client-side routes\n\nMany other flags are ignored too but it's normally not an issue.\n\n## WireGuard\n\nTunnelKit offers a user-friendly API to the modern [WireGuard\u00ae][dep-wireguard] protocol.\n\n### Manual Xcode steps\n\nIf you add any `TunnelKitWireGuard*` Swift package to the \"Link with binary libraries\" section of your app or tunnel extension, you are bound to hit this error:\n\n```\nld: library not found for -lwg-go\n```\n\nbecause part of the WireGuardKit package is based on `make`, which SwiftPM doesn't support yet.\n\nTherefore, make sure to follow the steps below for proper integration:\n\n- Copy `Scripts/build_wireguard_go_bridge.sh` somewhere in your project.\n- In Xcode, click File -> New -> Target. Switch to \"Other\" tab and choose \"External Build System\".\n- Type a name for your target.\n- Open the \"Info\" tab and replace `/usr/bin/make` with `$(PROJECT_DIR)/path/to/build_wireguard_go_bridge.sh` in \"Build Tool\".\n- Switch to \"Build Settings\" and find SDKROOT. Type in `macosx` if you target macOS, or type in `iphoneos` if you target iOS.\n- Locate your tunnel extension target and switch to \"Build Phases\" tab.\n- Locate \"Dependencies\" section and hit \"+\" to add the target you have just created.\n- Repeat the process for each platform.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Requirements\n\n- iOS 13.0+ / macOS 10.15+\n- SwiftPM 5.3\n- Git (preinstalled with Xcode Command Line Tools)\n- golang (for WireGuardKit)\n\nIt's highly recommended to use the Git package provided by [Homebrew][dep-brew].\n\n### Caveats\n\nMake sure to set \"Enable Bitcode\" (iOS) to NO, otherwise the library [would not be able to link OpenSSL][about-pr-bitcode] (OpenVPN) and the `wg-go` bridge (WireGuard).\n\nRecent versions of Xcode (latest is 13.1) have an issue where the \"Frameworks\" directory is replicated inside application extensions. This is not a blocker during development, but will prevent your archive from being validated against App Store Connect due to the following error:\n\n    ERROR ITMS-90206: \"Invalid Bundle. The bundle at '*.appex' contains disallowed file 'Frameworks'.\"\n\nYou will need to add a \"Run Script\" phase to your main app target where you manually remove the offending folder, i.e.:\n\n    rm -rf \"${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${PLUGINS_FOLDER_PATH}/YourTunnelTarget.appex/Frameworks\"\n\nfor iOS and:\n\n    rm -rf \"${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${PLUGINS_FOLDER_PATH}/YourTunnelTarget.appex/Contents/Frameworks\"\n\nfor macOS.\n\n### Demo\n\nDownload the library codebase locally:\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/passepartoutvpn/tunnelkit.git\n\nThere are demo targets containing a simple app for testing the tunnels. Open `Demo/TunnelKit.xcodeproject` in Xcode and run it on both iOS and macOS.\n\nFor the VPN to work properly, the demo requires:\n\n- _App Groups_ and _Keychain Sharing_ capabilities\n- App IDs with _Packet Tunnel_ entitlements\n\nboth in the main app and the tunnel extension targets.\n\nIn order to test connectivity in your own environment, modify the file `Demo/Demo/Configuration.swift` to match your VPN server parameters.\n\nExample:\n\n    private let ca = CryptoContainer(pem: \"\"\"\n\t-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n\tMIIFJDCC...\n\t-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n    \"\"\")\n\nMake sure to also update the following constants in the `*ViewController.swift` files, according to your developer account and your target bundle identifiers:\n\n    private let appGroup = \"...\"\n    private let tunnelIdentifier = \"...\"\n\nRemember that the App Group on macOS requires a team ID prefix.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe library is split into several modules, in order to decouple the low-level protocol implementation from the platform-specific bridging, namely the [NetworkExtension][ne-home] VPN framework.\n\nFull documentation of the public interface is available and can be generated by opening the package in Xcode and running \"Build Documentation\" (Xcode 13).\n\n### TunnelKit\n\nThis component includes convenient classes to control the VPN tunnel from your app without the NetworkExtension headaches. Have a look at `VPN` implementations:\n\n- `MockVPN` (default, useful to test on simulator)\n- `NetworkExtensionVPN` (anything based on NetworkExtension)\n\n### TunnelKitOpenVPN\n\nProvides the entities to interact with the OpenVPN tunnel.\n\n### TunnelKitOpenVPNAppExtension\n\nContains the `NEPacketTunnelProvider` implementation of a OpenVPN tunnel.\n\n### TunnelKitWireGuard\n\nProvides the entities to interact with the WireGuard tunnel.\n\n### TunnelKitWireGuardAppExtension\n\nContains the `NEPacketTunnelProvider` implementation of a WireGuard tunnel.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 Davide De Rosa.

  "readme_contents": "# RoadApplePi \nRoadApplePi is a simple to install system for your Raspberry Pi designed to record dashcam videos and engine information from your car in real-time, and then make it all accessable from an easy-to-use Web App that can be viewed on your smartphone or computer.\n\nDemonstration video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-G1HIgr2cvU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-G1HIgr2cvU)\n\n## Features\n - **Dashcam Recordings with car stats:** Whenever your RoadApplePi is powered on and connected to a webcam and Bluetooth OBD2 reader, it's recording every piece of information it can scrape up. Using hardware-accelerated video encoding, this results in smooth dashcam footage and an instrument cluster that shows exactly what you (and others around you) were doing at any given time.\n - **Real-time OBD (II) Information:** See what's going on under-the hood in real time with our \"Dashboard\" view\n - **Web App Access:** Many \"carputers\" based around the Raspberry Pi require the installation of a screen in your car, making them difficult to install. RoadApplePi works around this issue by giving you a modern web app that can be accessed from any internet-enabled device.\n - **Offline Access:** Need to view dashcam recordings while away from your RoadApplePi? Not a problem! The Web App works without an active connection to your Pi, and you can cache videos and instrument clusters for offline viewing.\n - **Wireless connectivity:** Most of the time, your car will be out of range of any WiFi network. RoadApplePi solves this issue by having the option to create a wireless network, specifically for ease-of-access to the web app. You also have the option to connect to an existing wireless network if you're in range.\n - **Set it up and forget about it:** If you're going all the way with an automated car power system, you won't have to touch your RoadApplePi again after the initial setup (see \"Power and Time Options\" for more details)\n - **..And more to come!** RoadApplePi is free software, developed in my free time. Depending on your help and support I hope to implement other features, such as:\n\t- More OBD pids (car stats)\n\t- The ability to read and log engine trouble codes\n\t- Tune your ECM\n\t- Export dashcam recordings with superimposed obd information as a video for complete compatibility\n\t- Become fully self-aware (just joking ... I hope)\n\n## What you need\nRoadApplePi is designed to work with as little or much as you have. Bare minimum, you'll need\n - **A Raspberry Pi.** Any model will work, but the RPi Zero W  or RPi 3 is recommended since they have Bluetooth and WiFi built in. Otherwise, a USB Bluetooth/WiFi dongle is required\n\t- Side note: This software was developed almost entirely on a RPi Zero W with few issues. However, due to the slow processor on this model, some things run slow. The Real-Time dashboard runs around 15 seconds behind, and loading the instrument cluster on recorded videos may take 20-30 seconds (after which, they play fine). If you're opting to use a slower model, I recommend doing the initial setup of a spare Raspberry Pi 2/3 to speed up the software compilation process. After that, the SD Card can be moved to your pi of choice\n - **Class 10 SD Card with Raspbian Stretch (optionally, the lite flavor):** This software was written to work on Raspbian Stretch, but it may work on other OSs. YMMV. Also, I recommend using at least a 16GB SD Card to give you enough space for your dashcam recordings. I've been using the same 32GB SD Card for the past 6 months with no issues. This gives me enough space to retain, on average, 3 weeks of recordings. If you need help setting up an SD Card with Raspbian, see [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/).\n - **A Webcam:** All development was done with an old USB webcam, but any webcam should work including Raspberry Pi-specific ones\n - **A power source:** Powering the beast is the trickiest part of the whole build. If you're just getting started, I'd recommend a 2A car phone charger with a micro USB cable to power the Pi. This won't automatically/cleanly power off your Pi, but it'll get it powered until you have a better solution in place. See \"Power and Time Options\" for more details.\n - **Bluetooth ELM327 OBDII adapter (optional)** While technically optional, a Bluetooth ELM327 adapter is required to record engine information. They're around $10 on Amazon and completely worth the price.\n\n## Installation\n 1. Flash Raspbian (lite) onto an SD Card and boot your Raspberry Pi, performing any initial setup needed to get it connected to the internet\n 2. From the command line, run:\n\t```\n\tsudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git\n\tgit clone https://github.com/JVital2013/RoadApplePi\n\tcd RoadApplePi\n\t./setup.sh\n\tsudo reboot\n\t```\n\tThe setup script may take several hours to run, depending on your Raspberry Pi model\n 3. On another device, go to `http://raspberrypi/`.\n\t--Note: Your device hostname can be changed by running `sudo raspi-config` on your pi. I've changed mine to \"roadapplepi\". A feature to change this from the web app will be added in the future\n 4. Put it into Access Point mode, specifying a network SSID and Password\n 5. After verifying that you can connect to the newly created WiFi network, shut down your Pi and move it out to your car. Connect your webcam to the Pi and the OBDII reader to your car and power the Pi back on\n 6. With your ignition in the \"Run\" position, go to `http://raspberrypi/` (or other hostname if you changed it). From the settings menu, pair your pi with the OBDII reader. Most of them use \"1234\" for the PIN.\n 7. Go for a drive and see how it works!\n\n## Power and Time Options\nIf you've made it to this point, great! You should have a fully functional black box in your car. However, you have most likely run into two issues\n\n 1. Raspberry Pis don't come with any sort of Real-Time Clock (RTC). In an internet-less location such as your car, your pi won't keep the time when turned off. You can partially solve this issue by synchronizing the time on the Pi with the time on your connected device (e.g. phone) via the web app, but this isn't optimal.\n 2. Powering your Pi with your car's cigarette lighter if fraught with peril. In many cars, these ports are not \"always on\" and turn off with the car. This won't gracefully shut down your Pi, corrupting all your data. Even if the port *is* always on, you don't want the Pi recording 24/7. There are power management options in the web app, but they again aren't optimal\n\nTo solve both of these issues, there are two solutions that I recommend\n\n### Mausberry Circuits 3A Car Supply / Switch and an RTC\nOut of the two, this is the simplest option, although it requires two components. The Mausberry Circuits 3A Car Supply (https://mausberry-circuits.myshopify.com/collections/frontpage/products/3a-car-supply-switch-1) performs two functions: it steps the car voltage down to a Pi-Friendly level, and gracefully shuts the Pi down automatically when the car powers off. On their web site, they mention wiring the device into your battery and ignition. Don't fret, you don't need to go to this extreme: you can use fuse taps to tap an always-on line, and an ignition-powered line in your fusebox. For more details on this, take a look at the SleepyPi 2 option.\n\nUnfortunately, the Mausberry power supply does not contain an RTC, so you'll need to purchase one separately (unless you don't care about incorrect times). For more information, see https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/adding-a-real-time-clock-to-raspberry-pi.pdf.\n\nFair warning, I haven't actually tried this, but it should work fine.\n\n### SleepyPi 2\nAlthough this option is more complicated in initial setup compared to the Mausberry, it's the path I opted for and I've had great success. The SleepyPi 2 (https://spellfoundry.com/product/sleepy-pi-2/) is inherently an Arduino-based \"Hat\" for the Raspberry Pi that can be programmed as needed. Out-of-the-box, the SleepyPi 2 performs 2 functions that we care about: voltage transformation to Raspberry Pi friendly voltages, and an easy-to-configure RTC. However, it does not automatically power off the Pi when the car is switched off.\n - It must be programmed to do this. I've already modified one of Spell Foundry's example programs to do just this, and is the `RoadApplePi.ino` file in this repository. To flash this sketch onto your Sleepy Pi, see https://spellfoundry.com/sleepy-pi/programming-arduino-ide/.\n - You need to build a voltage divider for the program to be able to properly read the current power status of the car.  Thanks to Spell Foundry, here's the voltage divider you need to build:  \n![Voltage Divider](https://spellfoundry.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Car-GPIO-Level-Signaller.png)  \nYou can build this circuit on whatever you would like, but I used a solderable breadboard. For those less well-versed in reading schematics, here's a quick explanation of what you're doing\n\t - *(Not shown in this schematic)* Wire an always-hot line from your fuse box to the VIN of the SleepyPi\n\t - Wire an ignition-dependent line into the voltage divider (signified by the 14.4V in the diagram)\n\t - Wire a ground wire from your car into both the voltage divider (very bottom of the diagram) and the 0V part of the power input on the SleepyPi.\n\t - *The outputs of the voltage divider are on the right of the diagram.* If you're using my SleepyPi sketch, wire the 3.09V output into Pin 14 of the Sleepy Pi, and the 0V output to the SleepyPi's GND\n - Once assembled, you're left with a 3-layer sandwich: your raspberry pi, the sleepy pi, and your voltage divider. Here's what mine looks like installed in my car:\n ![Isn't it purdy?](/../screenshots/mypi.jpg?raw=true)\n\n## Licensing\nRoadApplePi is released under the GPLv3.

Just take a quick glance at your battery\u2019s stats, whenever you want.\n\n![Apple Juice Today Widget](screenshot_today.png)\n\n# How do I install it? #\n\n* Install *Apple Juice* from the published binary, by downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/raphaelhanneken/apple-juice/releases/latest) and dropping it into your Applications folder.\n\n* Install *Apple Juice* using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), using the command `brew install --cask apple-juice`\n\n* You can also download the source code and build it yourself. You'll have to have [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) installed, and run `carthage bootstrap`, inside the project folder, to pull in the required dependencies.\n\n## ATTENTION ##\n__Loosen Gate Keeper Restrictions__\n> As I'm not paying for an Apple Developer Account, you have to allow unsigned third party apps within the system preferences, to run *Apple Juice*. To allow unsigned apps choose `Anywhere` under `System Preferences: Security: Allow apps downloaded from`. If you don't have the option to select `Anywhere` you'll have to loosen the Gate Keeper restrictions by running `sudo spctl --master-disable` in the Terminal. [OSXDaily](http://osxdaily.com/2016/09/27/allow-apps-from-anywhere-macos-gatekeeper/) have a great step by step guide. Afterwards you should be able to select Anywhere.\n\n__Remove Quarantine Attributes__\n> Alternatively you can remove the quarantine attribute from the downloaded application package, as suggested by [henrycodebreaker](https://github.com/henrycodebreaker) in [issue #18](https://github.com/raphaelhanneken/apple-juice/issues/18). By executing the following command inside your Terminal: `xattr -cr /path/to/Apple\\ Juice.app`.\n\n# Why does this project exist? #\nThere are plenty of other solutions out there, so why make another one? I wanted an app that looks like it\u2019s part of the system. As if it were built directly into macOS. Which can show me a lot of information, but only when I need them. And, most importantly, it should display notifications for several percentages. Since I haven\u2019t found such an app, I made one myself.\n\n# How do I contribute? #\nYou can fork this project, make your changes and send me a pull request. Make sure [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) succeeds and everything is translated before submitting your pull request. Or, since the whole source code is licensed under the MIT License, fork *Apple Juice* and make your own thing. :-)\n\n__________\n\n# License #\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 - 2020 Raphael Hanneken\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

  "readme_contents": "# iCloud API\n\nThis is an unofficial iCloud API that provides useful methods to interact with some services of iCloud.\n\n## Attention\n\nPlease make sure that this API is my private work and therefore it will never be supported by Apple. iCloud's endpoints and functionality can be changed every time by Apple. Using this project is on your risk and it's possible that apple bans your account. They can do whatever they want and because of the fact that it doesn't fits in to Apples agreements, I can not ensure using this API without risks.\n\nThe API's I've implemented are more less the same as Apple provides. Sometimes, the objects are simplified or a little bit restructured because the requirements of such a Javascript API are different from the original API Apple provides. But all in all it's Apple's data and I'm not the author of the idea how an API's result works in detail.\n\nI can not be sure that Apple does not provide any kind of changes in their API. That means, it is possible that something does not work as expected although you did it as it is described in the *Documentation* here.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install apple-icloud\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\n```javascript\n// Require the module\nconst iCloud = require('apple-icloud');\n\nvar session = {}; // An empty session. Has to be a session object or file path that points on a JSON file containing your session\nvar username = \"my.account@mail.com\"; // Your apple id\nvar password = \"totally-save-password\"; // Your password\n\n// This creates your iCloud instance\nvar myCloud = new iCloud(session, username, password);\n\nmyCloud.on(\"ready\", function() {\n  // This event fires when your session is ready to use. If you used a valid session as argument, it will be fired directly after calling 'new iCloud()' but sometimes your session is invalid and the constructor has to re-login your account. In this case this event will be fired after the time that is needed to login your account.\n});\n```\n\n### Session broken\n\nBasically, your instance always tries to use an existing session. You can pass a session by an object or a file path that points to a JSON file. If the passed session is invalid because of any reason, your instance will use your given credentials to re-login. If you did not gave any credentials to the constructor, your instance will try to get the credentials from the given (and obviously broken) session that are normally stored within.\n\n```javascript\n// This creates your iCloud instance\nvar myCloud = new iCloud(\"path/to/my/session.json\", username, password);\n```\nThis way is more practicable because it does a lot of stuff automatically. E.g. if your session is too old or invalid, this method just creates a new one.\nIf you use this way of logging in, you will be save that everything works fine. Therefore that is the recommended way.\n\nNow you have a working session and you should continue at [API](#API)\n\n### Instance Call\n\nI already explained that the way I use, is the recommended one but theoretically you can do everything manually.\n\nThe arguments I use here are all optional but if you don't use them you have to initialize your instance manually. That is possible but not easy as the way above with only three arguments.\n\n\n### Detailed Way (Not Recommended)\n\n#### Login manually\n\nAs I already explained, you can do everything manually.\n\n```javascript\n// This creates your iCloud instance without any arguments\nvar myCloud = new iCloud();\n\n// This creates a new session with your credentials. This is very slow if you do it every time and also not recommended because apple bans your account if you login too often in a small time area\nmyCloud.login(username, password, function(err) {\n  if (err) {\n    // An error occured\n  }\n  // You logged in successfully!\n});\n```\n\nThis is maybe interesting if you have an existing session but you want to re-login your account because of some reason I don't know. But please keep in mind that you really **should** use existing sessions much as possible because you save a lot of time and avoid being banned by Apple.\n\n### Export Session\n\nIf you have an existing session, you can export it just calling `exportSession()` in iCloud instance. This returns a session object that can be loaded the next time you create an iCloud instance `new iCloud(session, username, password)`.\n\n```javascript\nvar newSession = myCloud.exportSession();\n```\n\n#### Save Session\n\nYour iCloud instance (`myCloud`) also contains a method called `saveSession` that saves the session directly to a file path.\n\n```javascript\nmyCloud.saveSession(\"/path/to/my/session.json\");\n```\n\nIf you don't put a file path as argument, the method will use the path you used with `new iCloud(path, username, password)`. If you did not used such a file path there, an error occurs. In practise, that means you can do the following successfully:\n\n```javascript\nvar myCloud = new iCloud(\"path/to/my/session.json\", username, password);\n\n/*\n  Do your cool stuff.\n*/\n\n// Saves session to 'path/to/my/session.json' because your instance knows this path already and you used no custom one as argument\nmyCloud.saveSession();\n```\n\n#### Save Session automatically\n\nTo save the session automatically when something changes, just listen to the `sessionUpdate` event and apply `saveSession()`.\n\n```javascript\nmyCloud.on(\"sessionUpdate\", function() {\n  myCloud.saveSession();\n});\n```\n\n## IMPORTANT\n\n**Please**. Save your sessions and use them often as possible. This avoids problems with the API. If you do not use session saving, your client has to do the complete login process every time you start your script. This takes a lot of time and destroys functionality on Apples's servers because they may stop sending important cookies. Therefore: **Just do it.**\n\n## Two Factor Authentication\n\nIf the *two-factor-authentication* is required, your login works basically as expected. You get the `ready` event on your instance and so on.\n**But** you cannot use the most API's such as `Contacts`, `Mail`, `Notes` and so on unless you type in the *security code*. The only API's that are available are the ones that are also available on `iCloud.com` without typing in a security code, such as `FindMe`.\n\n### Check for Two Factor Authentication\n\nTo check wether the *two-factor-authentication* is required, you can do **2** things.\n\n1. Listen to the `err` event and check the error with the error code `15` and the message `Two-factor-authentication is required.`.\n2. Check the boolean variable `twoFactorAuthenticationIsRequired` of your iCloud instance.\n\n```javascript\n// ... Logged in successfully\n\nconst needsSecurityCode = myCloud.twoFactorAuthenticationIsRequired;\n\nif (needsSecurityCode) {\n  console.error(\"Two Factor Authentication is required. Type in your security code!\");\n}\nelse {\n  console.log(\"Everything okay. Go on!\");\n}\n```\n\n### Type in Security Code\n\nTo enable the other API's, you need to type in a security code that will be displayed on your devices.\n\n```javascript\n// Sample code '123456'\nmyCloud.securityCode = \"123456\";\n\n// When finished, a `ready` event will be triggered.\nmyCloud.on(\"ready\", function() {\n  // Ready event\n});\n```\n\nOf course, the `ready` event now will fire the second time because it already fired after first login (This returned the requirement of *two-factor-authentication*). To check wether the code is typed in now, look up the `twoFactorAuthenticationIsRequired` property that returns wether you need the security code (Should be `false` after you passed in a security code, otherwise the code seems to be invalid).\n\n### Example\n\nEverything sounds complicated?\n\nNo problem, just look at this short example for a login that supports *two-factor-authentication*. (Please keep in mind, that I am using `prompt` here, to get user's input. Of course, you can get your *security code* as you want).\n\n```javascript\n// ...\n// 'username' & 'password' are defined here...\n\n// This creates your iCloud instance\nvar myCloud = new iCloud(\"icloud-session.json\", username, password);\n\nmyCloud.on(\"ready\", function() {\n  console.log(\"Ready Event!\");\n  // Check if the two-factor-authentication is required\n  if (myCloud.twoFactorAuthenticationIsRequired) {\n    // Get the security code using node-prompt\n    prompt.get([\"Security Code\"], async function(err, input) {\n      if (err) return console.error(err);\n      const code = input[\"Security Code\"];\n      // Set the security code to the instance\n      myCloud.securityCode = code;\n    });\n  }\n  else {\n    // Now the 'ready' event fired but 'twoFactorAuthenticationIsRequired' is false, which means we don't need it (anymore)\n    console.log(\"You are logged in completely!\");\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Send Security Code Manually\n\nWhen you are trying to login but *two-factor-authentication* is required, a *security code* will normally be sent to your devices automatically.\n\nBut sometimes, you need a new one, an *SMS* or a *voice call*. To request this programmatically, the API provides the method `sendSecurityCode(mode)` that sends a security code to your devices directly, via *SMS* or via *Voice* (phone call).\n\nThere exist 3 `mode`'s. If you don't set a `mode`, the default one is `message`.\n1. `message` -> Sends a *security code* directly to your devices\n2. `sms` -> Sends an SMS containing a *security code* to your phone\n3. `voice` -> Calls your phone and speaks out a *security code*\n\nOf course, the SMS will be sent to the phone number connected with your AppleID...\n\n```javascript\n// Request SMS security code\nmyCloud.sendSecurityCode(\"sms\");\n\n// Request voice security code\nmyCloud.sendSecurityCode(\"voice\");\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nSometimes you run your script & give your credentials but no security code comes in?\nThis mostly happens because you set up a session that is partial completed but not fully complete. Try to delete your existing session file and try it again.\n\nAlso try to not wonder why you do not have to type in a security code a second time after using `test.js` or any other test environment. They save your session at `/tmp/icloud-session.json`. If you use it a second time, it just uses the old session.\n\n\n## Applications\n\nThis is the basic iCloud API that you can use to interact with iCloud services.\n\n* [Contacts](#contacts)\n* [Friends](#friends)\n* [Drive](#icloud--drive)\n* [Calendar](#calendar)\n* [Photos](#photos)\n* [Find Me](#find-me)\n* [Reminders](#reminders)\n* [Mail](#mail)\n* [Notes](#notes)\n\n\n### Contacts\n\n#### List\n\nThis method lists your account contacts data like groups and persons.\n\n```javascript\nmyCloud.Contacts.list(function(err, data) {\n  if (err) return console.error(err);\n  // Successfully your contacts :)\n  console.log(data);\n});\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/contacts/listContacts.js`\n\n#### IMPORTANT\n\nTo use `change()`, `new()` & `delete()` you firstly have to `list()` the contacts one time to become a valid `syncToken`!\n\n#### Change\n\nTo change a contact's properties, just change the object's properties and call `change(myContact)`.\n\n```javascript\nmyContact.lastName = \"NewLastName\";\n\nconst changeset = await myCloud.Contacts.change(myContact);\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/contacts/changeContact.js`\n\n#### Delete\n\nDeleting a contact is also easy like changing. Just use a contact's object as argument when calling `delete()`\n\n```javascript\nconst delChangeset = await myCloud.Contacts.delete(myContactIDontLike);\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/contacts/deleteContact.js`\n\n#### New\n\nCreating a new contact is also really simple. You put a self-made contact-object as argument to `new()`. What a kind of properties a contact can have, is Apples work and this API just use apples JSON structures. If you need to know it, just loadan existing contact and have a look at it's object structure.\n\n```javascript\nconst createChangeset = await myCloud.Contacts.new({\n  firstName: 'New',\n  lastName: 'Guy',\n  emailAddresses: [\n    {\n      label: \"Privat\",\n      field: \"the.mail.address@mail.com\"\n    }\n  ],\n  isCompany: false\n});\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/contacts/newContact.js`\n\n### Friends\n\n```javascript\nconst locations = await myCloud.Friends.getLocations();\n```\n\nPlease also remember that the fist requests maybe doesn't returns a position for the devices (Same thing when using *FindMe*) because the position is still in progress. Sometimes you have to wait a few seconds.\n\n**Demo:** `demo/friends/getLocations.js`\n\n\n### iCloud Drive\n\nThe drive services are not completed yet.\n\nThis API is a little bit more complex because it implements a really useful implementation of unix paths in icloud. Please read the following paragraph to the end before using the API.\n\n\niCloud Drive's endpoints doesn't work with UNIX paths like */path/to/my/file*. But iCloud Drive use something called *drivewsid*. That is an id that points on your items in iCloud Drive.\n\nIf you list a folder, it returns the *drivewsid*'s of it's sub items. You can request them than.\n\nThe *drivewsid* of the root folder of iCloud Drive is `FOLDER::com.apple.CloudDocs::root`.\n\nAll methods of this API accept as first argument such a *drivewsid*.\n\n#### Get Item\n\n```javascript\nconst itemInfo = await myCloud.Drive.getItem(\"FOLDER::com.apple.CloudDocs::root\");\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/drive/getItem.js`\n\n#### Error?\n\nMay you see the error **\"No PCS cookies\"**. This is because you logged in too often and icloud servers does not send them to you anymore or your actual session just does not have any PCS cookies. In any case, wait a few seconds up to minutes and reset your session. And **please** store your sessions! This will avoid such problems!\n\nIf you do his, you will see that you become a list with root's sub items and the related *drivewsid*'s. Theoretically you can work so.\n\n#### Use UNIX file paths\n\nBut because I really like to use UNIX file paths directly I implemented a way that let you use them.\nThat means you can just use a UNIX file path instead of a *drivewsid* if you know the path to your item.\n\n```javascript\nconst itemInfo = await myCloud.Drive.getItem(\"/myFolder/contains/my/nice/item.txt\", undefined, true); // If using folder cache (Only necessary for UNIX paths) (Default is true)\n```\n\n##### Result\n\nIf you request a folder item, you get an array of the contained files within. But this array only contains general info about each file but not the whole contents. To get them, request the file seperetaly.\n\n##### IMPORTANT\n\nBecause of the problem that my API hast to list every folder within the path of the requested item, this alernative is not very fast. For example if you request `/Folder1/SubFolder/Item.txt` the API hast to do 4 requests (*root*, *Folder1*, *SubFolder* & *Item.txt*).\n\nBut to speed it up, I implemented the possibility to cache everything. For example if you request `/Folder1/SubFolder/Item.txt`, every folder will be cached. Next time you request `/Folder1/SubFolder/Item 2.txt`, the folders on the *way* to `Item 2.txt` are not loaded again to speed it up. The **last** item in your path will ever be requested again each time. For example if you request `/Folder1/SubFolder` it needs 3 requests the first time (*root*, *Folder1* & *SubFolder*). Now, if you request again `/Folder1/SubFolder` the cache will only be used for *root* and *Folder1*. *SubFolder* is the target item you want and therefore it will be request again.\n\nTo avoid using the cache generally you can set the **third argument** to `false`. Default it is `true`.\n\nThis is just a feature, I have implemented and if you do not like it, just use the *docwsid*'s to request your data. That is much more *native* because iClouds internal API work in this way.\n\n##### Result\n\nHow the strucuture of your requested item looks like, is the structure Apple created for their API's. In some cases I simplified some structures but all in all it's not my stuff.\n\nTo become an impression of such a result, just try it out :)\n\n#### Rename Items\n\nThe renaming works really similar. It also accepts UNIX paths but also *docwsid*'s. The only difference is that it accepts a list with items.\n\n```javascript\nconst changeset = await myCloud.Drive.renameItems({\n  \"/my/item/with/path.txt\": \"new name.txt\", // Of course you can use a drivewsid\n  \"Oh/another/item.txt\": \"renamed.txt\" // Of course you can use a drivewsid\n}, undefined, true); // If using folder cache (Only necessary for UNIX paths) (Default is true)\n```\n\nBut please remember that it can cost a lot of time when there many not cached folders on the way and you use UNIX paths.\n\n**Demo:** `demo/drive/renameItems.js`\n\n\n#### Delete Items\n\nThe same logic works when using `deleteItems()`. The only difference is that you don't use an object as argument but an array. Theoretically you can also use single string if you just have one item to delete.\n\n```javascript\nconst delChangeset = await myCloud.Drive.deleteItems([\n  \"/Test/this folder is new\",\n  \"/Test/this folder is also new\"\n], undefined, true); // If using folder cache (Only necessary for UNIX paths) (Default is true)\n```\n\nBut please remember that it can cost a lot of time when there many not cached folders on the way and you use UNIX paths.\n\n**Demo:** `demo/drive/deleteItems.js`\n\n#### Create Folders\n\nThis method provides functionality to create multiple folders in one parent folder\n\n```javascript\n// 1st argument: '/Test' is the parent folder ( Can always be a 'drivewsid'! )\n// 2nd argument: Array with new folders\nconst createChangeset = await myCloud.Drive.createFolders(\"/Test\", [\"this folder is new\"], undefined, true); // If using folder cache (Only necessary for UNIX paths) (Default is true)\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/drive/createFolders.js`\n\n\n#### Upload File\n\n**Still in progress**\n\n### Calendar\n\nThe iCloud Calendar services have a little bit more complicated structure. Therefore I restructured the original objects a little bit to make it easier to work with the event data. That means it is theoretically possible that Apple makes significant changes on their API that stop my methods working.\n\n#### Get Collections\n\n*Collection* means just the different groups of events such like 'Private' or 'Work'.\nList your collections is a save way to know on which points you can define new events.\nYou do it like the following:\n\n```javascript\nconst collections = await myCloud.Calendar.getCollections();\n```\n\nThe structure of a collection is not so complicated, therefore I don't explain it detailed. Just have a look at it and try it out :)\n\n**Demo:** `demo/calendar/getCollections.js`\n\n#### Get Events\n\nPlease note that this maybe takes time because every event is requested for details one times. That's because the original Apple API returns the events not detailed if I request for an time area. I have to do another request for every event to get its detailed information. To get the progress of the complete method, just listen to *progress* event of your iCloud instance and have a look at `parentAction: 'getEvents'` and the related `progress`.\n\n```javascript\n// Get all events from the 7th July 2017 to 9th August 2017\nconst events = await myCloud.Calendar.getEvents(\"2017-07-15\", \"2017-08-09\");\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/calendar/getEvents.js`\n\nPlease keep always in mind that the possibility of working with Javascript's Date objects within events when getting them or creating is my personal workaround to make handling the API more easy. Apple's internal way of handling dates is an array driven solution that is not native as a Date-Object literal. Because of that it can be theoretically possible that you get a property I forgot to parse into Javascript's Date-Object. THis property would look like an array...\n\nAn event contains a lot of properties such like `recurrence`, `alarms` which explains the rules for repeating the event in future or every alarms that will be triggered. Just have a look at these objects to understand it detailed. It's not so complicated ;-)\n\n\n#### Create Collection\n\n```javascript\nconst createChangeset = await myCloud.Calendar.createCollection({\n  // Properties for your collection (Everything like id's will be calculated automatically)\n  title: \"Mein Kalendar 2!\", // The name of the collection\n  color: \"#ffe070\" // The color that will be displayed in iCloud clients and represent the collection (Optional default is #ff2d55)\n});\n```\n\nA created **collection** gets a specific `guid` from Apple it will be identified with.\n\n**Demo:** `demo/calendar/createCollection.js`\n\n#### Create Event\n\nRemember the same as you noticed for creating a contact. For creating a event, use the same object structure as you know from 'getEvents()'.\n\nIn this code example is not every possible property used. Everything that can be in a event you got, can also be here.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst createChangeset = await myCloud.Calendar.createEvent({\n  title: \"Viele\", // Required\n  location: \"My City\", // Optional\n  description: \"This is the best description ever\", // Optional\n  url: \"https://maurice-conrad.eu\", // Optional\n  pGuid: \"home\", // 'guid' of collection\n  alarms: [ // Lists all alarms (Optional)\n    {\n      before: true,\n      weeks: 0,\n      days: 0,\n      hours: 0,\n      minutes: 35,\n      seconds: 0\n    }\n  ],\n  recurrence: { // Describes the rule to repeat the event\n    count: 3, // How many times the event will be repeated (Optional, default is Infinity)\n    freq: \"daily\", // Type of frequence (e.g. 'daily', 'weekly')\n    interval: 10 // Interval for frequence\n  },\n  startDate: new Date(\"2017-07-26 12:00\"), // UTC Time is required from local, therefore the event start time means your local 12:00)\n  endDate: new Date(\"2017-07-26 13:00\") // Same here\n});\n```\n\nPlease keep always in mind that the possibility of working with Javascript's Date objects within events when getting them or creating is my personal workaround to make handling the API more easy. Apple's internal way of handling dates is an array driven solution that is not native as a Date-Object literal. Because of that it can be theoretically possible that you get a property I forgot to parse into Javascript's Date-Object. This property would look like an array...\n\n**Demo:** `demo/calendar/createEvent.js`\n\n##### Properties\n\nBecause the sepific properties to describe a task and its alarms, is part of Apple's internal API, I do not offer a documentation about this properties and their values because they can change every time.\n\nTo get an idea about the specific properties, try out some tasks and have a look at their objects literal using `getOpenTasks()` or `getCompletedTasks()`.\nThe API's are transmitted directly without changes except datetime data. I try to parse it all into **Date** objects, so you don't have to care about the internal way of transmitting datetimes.\n\nAn exception I made is `Recurrence` you see below. But always keep in mind that the sepific properties used here may not work later... But normally Apple will not change their API every 5 minutes ;-)\n\n##### Recurrence\n\nThe `recurrence` object contains a few properties that control the exact type of recurring the event.\nThese properties are\n\n```javascript\n{\n  freq: \"daily\", // 'daily' || 'weekly', || 'monthly', 'yearly'\n  count: null, // Count of recurring events, Default: Infinity for a never ending recurrence\n  interval: 1, // Interval of frequency  \n  byDay: null,\n  byMonth: null,\n  until: [Date], // Exact date on which the recurrence should be stopped\n  frequencyDays: null,\n  weekDays: null\n}\n```\n\nThe properties `count` & `until` contradict each other. *Just use one of them to describe the recurrence.*\n\n\n#### Delete Event\n\n```javascript\n// 'myEventIDontLike' is just an event object you got from 'getEvents()'\n\n// 2nd argument: true - If you want to delete all recurred events ('recurrence') (Default is false)\nconst delChangeset = await myCloud.Calendar.deleteEvent(myEventIDontLike, true);\n```\n\nIf you want to delete **all** recurring events after one special event, just set the 2nd argument to `true`. This will **not** delete all events before the event you set as 1st argument but all of the same type *after* it.\n\nFor example, if you have an event that starts at 7th of July and will be recurred every day and you want to delete all recurring events after the 10th of July, you have to use the event object of 10th of July as 1st argument and set the 2nd argument to `true`. This will delete all events of this type since the 10th of July but not the events *before* the 10th of July.\n\n**Demo:** `demo/calendar/deleteEvent.js`\n\n#### Change Event\n\n```javascript\n// 'myEvent' is just an event object you got from 'getEvents()'\nmyEvent.location = \"This place is much better\";\n// 2nd argument: true - If you want to change all recurred events ('recurrence') (Default is false)\nconst changeset = await myCloud.Calendar.changeEvent(myEvent, true);\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/calendar/changeEvent.js`\n\n### Photos\n\n#### Get Photos\n\nPlease make sure that this service needs *PCS-Cookies*. Sometimes they aren't there because of some security aspects of iCloud (e.g. You take too many logins in a small time area). Don't care about this normally, just keep it in mind when something doesn't work as expected.\n\n```javascript\nconst images = await myCloud.Photos.get();\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/photos/getPhotos.js`\n\n#### Upload Photo\n\n**Still in progress**\n\n###  Find Me\n\nThis service represents the *Find my iPhone* functionality of iCloud.\n\n##### Attention\n\nThis service is very good protected by Apple. As you know from iCloud.com you have to retype your credentials to use *FindMe* when your session is older than a few minutes. That means, *FindMe* needs fresh cookies and therefore you have to retype your credentials. It is also so, that theoretically *FindMe* needs an initialization and handles the requests a little bit complicated. Therefore I implemented a solution that does everything automatically, you just have to give your credentials to the method and than everything works automatically. If the request is the first one in your session, my method will initialize everything and so on. Of course, this takes more time. After this initialization the method shall work faster.\n\n#### Get\n\n```javascript\nconst devices = await myCloud.FindMe.get(\"my.account@mail.com\", \"totally-save-password\");\n```\n\nYou do not have to give your credentials again, these arguments are optional. Normally they will be used from the session instantly. (Your session remembers your password if you do not delete it).\n\n**Demo:** `demo/findme/findMe.js`\n\nPlease also remember that the fist requests maybe does not return a position for the devices (Same thing when using *Friends*) because the position is still in progress. Sometimes you have to wait a few seconds.\n\nThat means in detail, that `get()` performs a new general initialization whose logic I want to prevent from you when using the API and, if needed, a new *login* when it is performed the first time. After that, the data will be requested normally. If your current instance always initialized `FindMe` in this way, the *re-login* will perfom only at the first time. After that your data is tried to get directly when using `get()`. But sometimes (after using it a few minutes) the cookies are too old and the data can not be requested. In this case an error occurs and you should set `initialized` property of your instance's `FindMe` object to `false`:\n```javascript\n// 'get()' occured an error that the cookies are non-existing or too old\nmyCloud.FindMe.initialized = false;\n\n\n// A new call 'get()' will re-initialize everything\nconst devices = await myCloud.FindMe.get(\"my.account@mail.com\", \"totally-save-password\");\n```\n\nSadly there are still problems with the API. Sometimes the cookies of the session are invalid in general and `get()` still does not not work.\n\nIn this case you have to reset your whole session :(\n\n#### Play Sound\n\nTo play sound on a device, use the `playSound()` method.\n\n```javascript\n// By giving a device's object\nawait myCloud.FindMe.playSound(myDevice);\n\n// By giving just a device's ID\nawait myCloud.FindMe.playSound(\"XXX\");\n```\n\nTo get a device's object, just call `FindMe.get()`. This lists all devices and their related ID.\n\n**Demo:** `demo/findme/playSound.js`\n\n### Reminders\n\nThis service represents the *Reminders* app of iCloud.\nPleaae note that it's also not completed yet!\n\nAs I already said, I implemented Apples internal API's here and changed the object structure just when it was useful or to simplify the data. But the way what data is in which context given, is not my idea but Apples's.\nIn this case the collections and the *open* tasks are represented by one single enpoint. I restructured the result a little bit but all in all, it is one method. The *completed* tasks are represented by an own endpoint that doesn't returns collections. And that is the way it works. To split *collections* and *open* tasks into two methods would just slow down performance because of the fact that you would need to call two requests that get exactly the same data. Of course, that would be the more sinful way because of the fact that the enpoint that for *completed* doesn't returns *collections*. But I can't do any thing.\n\n#### Get Open Tasks and Collections\n\nAs I already explained, these methods return **collections** and within them, the tasks they are containing.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst tasks = await myCloud.Reminders.getOpenTasks();\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/reminders/getOpenTasks.js`\n\n#### Get Completed Tasks\n\nTo get a list with all completed tasks\n\n```javascript\nmyCloud.Reminders.getCompletedTasks(function(err, tasks) {\n  // If an error occurs\n  if (err) return console.error(err);\n  // All completed tasks (Not sorted by collections!)\n  console.log(tasks);\n});\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/reminders/getCompletedTasks.js`\n\n#### Delete Task\n\n```javascript\n// 'myTaskIDontLike' is just a task object we want to delete\n\nconst delChangeset = await myCloud.Reminders.deleteTask(myTaskIDontLike);\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/reminders/deleteTask.js`\n\n#### Change Task\n\n```javascript\n// 'myTask' is just a task object we want to change\n\nmyTask.title = \"This is the new title :)\"; // Don't use special characters like '\u00e4', '\u00f6', etc.\nconst changeset = await myCloud.Reminders.changeTask(myTask);\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/reminders/changeTask.js`\n\n#### Create Task\n\n```javascript\nconst createChangeset = await myCloud.Reminders.createTask({\n  title: \"I have to do this!\",\n  pGuid: \"tasks\", // The 'guid' of a collection\n  priority: 1, // 1 is \"High\", 5 is \"Medium\" & 9 is \"Low\",\n  description: \"This describes by task perfectly!\"\n});\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/reminders/createTask.js`\n\n##### Properties\n\nBecause the sepeific properties to describe a task and its alarms, is part of Apple's internal API, I do not offer a documentation about this properties and their values because they can change every time.\n\nTo get an idea about the specific properties, try out some tasks and have a look at their objects literal using `getOpenTasks()` or `getCompletedTasks()`.\nThe API's are transmitted directly without changes except datetime data. I try to parse it all into **Date** objects, so you don't have to care about the internal way of transmitting datetimes.\n\n#### Complete Task\n\nTo complete a task, just do the following:\n(Please note that something like a *uncomplete* action is currently not implemented and therefore only possible manually. It's still in progress)\n\n```javascript\n// 'myTaskICompleted' is the task you want to define as 'completed'\n\nconst chageset = await myCloud.Reminders.completeTask(myTaskICompleted);\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/reminders/completeTask.js`\n\n#### Create Collection\n\n```javascript\nconst createChangeset = await myCloud.Reminders.createCollection({\n  title: \"My new collection\",\n  symbolicColor: \"green\" // Default 'auto'\n});\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/reminders/createCollection.js`\n\nA created **collection** gets a specific `guid` from Apple it will be identified with.\n\nAs you may know from `Calendar`, you were allowed to use hex color codes as *#fa7b3d* when using a color for a *collection*. Sadly, `Reminders` API does not allow this kind of setting colors. We are only allowed to use specific color codes as `green`, `blue`, `red`, `orange`, `purple`, `yellow` or `brown`\n\n#### Change Collection\n\n```javascript\n// 'myCollection' is just a collection we want to change\nmyCollection.symbolicColor = \"green\"; // Sets the symbolic color of the collection to 'green'\nconst changeset = await myCloud.Reminders.changeCollection(myCollection);\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/reminders/changeCollection.js`\n\n#### Delete Collection\n\n```javascript\n// 'myCollectionIDontLike' is just a collection object we want to delete\n\nconst delChangeset = await myCloud.Reminders.deleteCollection(myCollectionIDontLike);\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/reminders/deleteCollection.js`\n\n### Mail\n\nPlease make sure that you have Mail activated for iCloud.\n\nPlease keep in mind that the Mail service of iCloud and all related endpoints need some special cookies that are given when the first request for any of Mail's services is did. After that your session has the required cookies and the API's can be used. All of my Mail API's are designed in way that they repeat itself automatically if the cookies are needed and save them. Of course a `sessionUpdate` fires which makes it easy to save the session. Therefore you have to do nothing. I just say this because you shouldn't wonder if the first Mail API action takes longer than expected because your client has to do at least two requests instead of one.\n\n#### Get Folders\n\nMailing systems in general work with folders that sort your mails. Such as `Sent`, `Inbox`, `Deleted`, `VIP` and your own folders.\n\n```javascript\nconst folders = await myCloud.Mail.getFolders();\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/mail/getFolders.js`\n\nJust try it out and have a look at the structure :)\n\n#### List Messages\n\n```javascript\n// 'myFolder' is just a folder object we got from 'getFolders()'\n// The 2nd and 3rd argument describe that we list the next 50 mails beginning at index 1 (first/newest mail)\n// The sort order is descending / newest mails first\nconst messagesData = await myCloud.Mail.listMessages(myFolder, 1, 50);\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/mail/listMessages.js`\n\nThe message objects you get here just contains meta data about the message and a preview in plain text.\n\n#### Get Message's Detail\n\nMaybe you already noticed that a message object from 'listMessages' doesn't contains the complete mail. That's because a message can be very large. To get the complete message content you have to request it separately:\n\n```javascript\n// 'myMail' is just a message object we got from 'listMessages()'\nconst messageDetail = await myCloud.Mail.getMessage(myMail);\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/mail/getMessage.js`\n\n#### Move Messages\n\nPlease notice that you can only move messages that are part the same folder to a common destination folder with one API call. Otherwise an error will occur. To move multiple messages that are part of *different* folders to a common destination, you need multiple API calls.\n\n```javascript\n// Items of the array are the messages you want to move (message objects)\n// Has to be an array if you have more than one messages you want to move. If it's only one message, it's message object can be used as argument instead\nconst changeset = await myCloud.Mail.move([\n  myMessage1, // The two messages have to be in the same folder!\n  myMessage2 // Otherwise an error will occur\n], destinationFolder); // 2nd argument is the destination folder (folder object)\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/mail/moveMessages.js`\n\n#### Delete Message\n\n```javascript\n// Items of the array are the messages you want to move (message objects)\n// Has to be an array if you have more than one messages you want to move. If it's only one message, it's message object can be used as argument instead\nconst delChangeset = await myCloud.Mail.delete([\n  myMessage1,\n  myMessage2\n]);\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/mail/deleteMessages.js`\n\nPlease keep in mind that a message you delete will normally just be moved to *TRASH* folder. Just if you delete a message within the *TRASH* folder, the message will be deleted completely.\n\n#### Flag\n\nFlagging is like *marking/selecting* your message. There are two existing **flags** iCloud Mail accepts.\n\n1. `unread` Mostly known as the blue point on the left side of your mail\n2. `flagged` A mostly orange flag or point on your message\n\n##### Add Flag\n\n```javascript\n// 1st argument is the message (myMessages is just an array containing message objects literal)\n// 2nd argument is the flag you want to add. Possible values are 'flagged' and 'unread'. Default is 'flagged'.\nconst flagChangeset = await myCloud.Mail.flag([\n  myMessages[0],\n  myMessages[1]\n], \"flagged\");\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/mail/flagMessages.js`\n\n##### Remove Flag\n\n```javascript\n// 1st argument is the message (myMessages is just an array containing message objects literal)\n// 2nd argument is the flag you want to remove. Possible values are 'flagged' and 'unread'. Default is 'flagged'.\nconst unflagChangeset = await myCloud.Mail.unflag([\n  myMessages[0],\n  myMessages[1]\n], \"unread\");\n```\n\nPlease keep in mind that `unread` means really unread. That means to flag your message as **read** you have to **unflag** the `unread` flag.\n\n**Demo:** `demo/mail/unflagMessages.js`\n\n\n#### Send Mail\n\nTo send a mail, you should remember that if you do not use a `from` property, this method will try to get your iClouds mail address using a second API. If you didn't performed a `__preference()` method before (which will mostly be the case), the `send()` method will do this to get your iCloud's mail address. Of course only if you did not give it as property (`from`). And of course, such a second API call in background will take more time.\n\n```javascript\nconst sentment = await myCloud.Mail.send({\n  //from: \"Your Name<your.address@icloud.com>\", If not given, your address will be found automatically\n  to: \"conr.maur@googlemail.com\", // Required\n  subject: \"Your API\",\n  body: \"<strong>Hey Maurice,</strong><br><br>I totally love your <i>API</i>. Of course it's not perfect but <strong>I love it</strong>\", // HTML string\n  attachments: [ // Optional\n    // Your attachments\n    // Not implemented yet\n    // Coming soon\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/mail/sendMail.js`\n\n#### Create Folder\n\n```javascript\nconst createChangeset = await myCloud.Mail.createFolder({\n  name: \"My new Folder\", // Default null\n  parent: null // Can be a folder object or a guid string (Default null)\n});\n```\n\nSadly there exist a bug within the web application of iCloud. If you create a folder with this API, sometimes, the web app will need a lot of time to get the new folder. But if you delete or rename an existing folder, your new folder becomes visible. I don't know the reason but all in all, your folder exist in iCloud's database and a `getFolders()` call will return the new folder.\n\n**Demo:** `demo/mail/createFolder.js`\n\n#### Move Folder\n\nPlease keep in mind that you are not allowed to move one of iCloud's default folders such as \"Inbox\", \"Drafts\", \"Archive\", \"Deleted Messages\" or \"Junk\".\nYou are only allowed to move your own folders with the `role` `FOLDER`;-)\n\n```javascript\n// 'myFolder' is just a folder object\n// 'myTargetFolder' is also just a folder object\nconst moveChangeset = await myCloud.Mail.moveFolder(myFolder, myTargetFolder);\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/mail/moveFolder.js`\n\nIf you want to move a sub folder from its parent folder to \"global\" level without a parent, set the 2nd argument (*targetFolder*) to. This will remove the `parent` property and your folder is global.\n\n#### Rename Folder\n\nPlease keep in mind that you are not allowed to rename one of iCloud's default folders such as \"Inbox\", \"Drafts\", \"Archive\", \"Deleted Messages\" or \"Junk\".\nYou are only allowed to rename your own folders with the `role` `FOLDER`;-)\n\n```javascript\n// 'myFolder' is just a folder object\nconst renameChangeset = await myCloud.Mail.renameFolder(myFolder, \"New Name\");\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/mail/renameFolder.js`\n\nSadly there exist a bug within the web application of iCloud. If you rename a folder with this API, sometimes, the web app will need a lot of time to update the folder. But if you delete or rename an existing folder in the web app, your folder's name becomes visible. I don't know the reason but all in all, your folder exist in iCloud's database and a `getFolders()` will return the correct name.\n\n#### Delete Folder\n\n```javascript\n// 'myFolder' is just a folder object\nconst delChangeset = await myCloud.Mail.deleteFolder(myFolder);\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/mail/deleteFolder.js`\n\nSadly there exist a bug within the web application of iCloud. If you delete a folder with this API, sometimes, the web app will need a lot of time to get the updated folder list. But if you delete or rename an existing folder in the web app, your deleted folder would stop being visible. I don't know the reason but all in all, your folder exist in iCloud's database and a `getFolders()` will return the correct folder list.\n\n\n### Notes\n\n#### Attention\n\nThe database of your notes can be very large. And therefore the internal API of Apple uses `records`. A normal iCloud client requests for a *zone* (There is only one zone called *Notes*) and gets just a few notes. Now, if the user scrolls down, more records will be requested. That is the way how Apple's API works.\n\nTo make this process more dynamic, use the `fetch()` method which gets all notes as records asynchrounsly.\n\n**Note**: By default a Note record\n\n#### Fetch Notes\n\nWhen using `fetch()` all `Note` records will be stored at the `__notes` key within your notes emitter (return of `get()`). If you want to know the parent folder of a note given in `__notes` while the related folder is unknown at the moment, you can use `getFolder()` instead of waiting until the related folder comes trough `get()`.\n\n```javascript\n// Get all notes\nconst notes = myCloud.Notes.fetch();\n\nnotes.on(\"data\", zone => {\n  // Do not use zone by default, the notes are sorted into 'folders'\n\n  // 'folders' is an array containing all notes sorted by folders that are known at this point of time\n  // Because of the fact, that the folders are coming over a zone, it may takes some time\n  console.log(notes.folders);\n\n  // Just log the notes you already got\n  //console.log(notes.__notes);\n});\n\nnotes.on(\"end\", () => {\n  // Now, you can be sure that EACH folder and EACH note are known\n  console.log(note.folders);\n})\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/notes/fetch.js`\n\n#### Resolve Notes\n\nBecause `fetch()` returns `Note` records just containing `TitleEncrypted` `SnippetEncrypted` fields, call `resolve()` to get the Note's full content and encode the base64 snippet and title automatically. As arguments pass `Note` records or their `recordName` instead.\n\n```javascript\n// Returns array of your notes detailed\nconst notesDetailed = await myCloud.Notes.resolve(note1, note2); // note1 and note2 are Note record objects or 'recordName' strings\n\nconsole.log(notesDetailed);\n```\n\n\n**Demo:** `demo/notes/resolveNotes.js`\n\n#### Get Folders\n\nGet folder objects directly. Use this method if you need a Note's parent folder until this folder is unknown at the moment.\n\n```javascript\n// 'myFolder1' & 'myFolder2' can be folder objects but also a plain 'recordName' as string (Useful if you know a folder's 'recordName' from a 'Note' record but not it's whole object because it is a record you actually don't have)\nmyCloud.Notes.getFolders([ // Can also be a single folder object or a single 'recordName' string\n  myFolder1,\n  myFolder2\n], function(err, folders) {\n  // If an error occurs\n  if (err) return console.error(err);\n  // Array with your folder's data\n  console.log(folders);\n});\n```\n\n**Demo:** `demo/notes/getFolders.js`\n\n## Push Services\n\nTo use push services to recognize when something changes, you need to register a service for being notified by Apple's push service.\n\nYou just have to follow these instructions:\n\n### Initialization\n\nBecause a push notification is more less an infinity loop of requests, the programmatically logic behind listening for push services keeps your script running.\n\nBecause this is may not your intention, the logic behind push services will not be initialized automatically when initializing your instance. You have to do it manually:\n\nSometimes, your token is expired. In this case, the method `initPush()` will automatically request a new one. But of course, this takes a little bit more time.\n\n```javascript\n// This initializes your instance to listen for push notifications in general\nmyCloud.initPush();\n\n// Your script will keep running until you do not shut it down manually\n```\n\n### Push Event\n\nGetting push notifications:\n\n```javascript\nmyCloud.on(\"push\", function(notification) {\n  console.log(\"New push notification!\");\n  console.log(notification);\n});\n```\n\nPlease note, that you can omly get `push` events for registered services.\n\n\n## Events\n\nThere are a few events you can listen to. For example the `progress` event that fires every time, an action is divided into some sub actions that need time. For example the *login* process fires **three** `progress` events.\n\nIf you `getEvents()` from *Calendar*, the count of fired *progress* events is related to the total amount of events that have to be requested for detailed information about them.\n\nAs I already explained, the *FindMe* service often requires a new login. The `get` method of *FindMe* does this automatically. And in this case a new `login()` will be executed which means that there will also three `progress` events fired.\n\n### Progress Event\n\n```javascript\nmyCloud.on(\"progress\", function(event) {\n  console.log(event);\n});\n```\n\n#### Result\n\n```javascript\n{\n  parentAction: \"yourMethod\", // The method name of the method the action is related to\n  action: \"what-currently-happens\", // A special keyword that describes the current action\n  progress: 0.5 // Number between 0 and 1\n  /*\n\n    Some specific properties of the current action\n\n  */\n}\n```\n\n### Ready Event\n\nThis event is used when you call the `iCloud` instance with a session and your credentials. *(Recommended way of initialization)*. Then, the `ready` fires when your session is valid or (if not) the automatic login process will be finished. It is really useful if you want to write less code and a clean way initialization including all kinds of error handling such as invalid credentials, invalid sessions or expired cookies.\n\n```javascript\nmyCloud.on(\"ready\", function() {\n  // Your iCloud instance is ready to use!\n});\n```\n\nPlease note that the time your instance needs to be `ready` is related to the fact wether you already have a valid working session or your session has to be re-initialized completely (because cookies are expired or something else is broken). In such a case a complete new `login()` process will be executed which takes time.\n\n### Session Update Event\n\nThis event fires every time when the current session updates. For example, if new cookies are request (e.g. when using *FindMe*). It fires also after a normal login. You should use it to save your session at this point.\n\n```javascript\nmyCloud.on(\"sessionUpdate\", function() {\n  // Session changed\n});\n```\n\n### Error Event\n\n**Please note**, the `err` event is *not* used to determine wether a method does not work. In such a case, you get an error thrown normally by a rejected promise or, if you are using the callback function, as **1st argument**. The `err` event is fired every time an error occurs but the method is not failed instantly. E.g. If you do not have a session, your cookies are too old or a broken one, an `err` event fires that determines that your instance was not abled to use your current session. But of course, the instance will login your account a second time and is trying to create a new session. Or, if you log in but a two-factor-authentication is required, an `err` event fires. In this case you should enter your *code* as explained in [Two Factor Authentication](#two--factor--authentication).\n\n### Error Event\n\n```javascript\nmyCloud.on(\"err\", function(event) {\n  console.error(event);\n});\n```\n\n## Important\n\nI do not support any malicious use or abuse of this project that harms third parties, steals data or violates personals rights.

Not all services are completed, there is always stuff to do. At the moment, it is still in progress and I'm working on it much as possible :)\n\n## Thanks\n\nThanks for your Attention.

  "readme_contents": "# CombineFeedback\n\nUnidirectional Reactive Architecture. This is a [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) implemetation of [ReactiveFeedback](https://github.com/Babylonpartners/ReactiveFeedback) and [RxFeedback](https://github.com/kzaher/RxFeedback)\n\n## Diagram\n\n![](diagrams/ReactiveFeedback.jpg)\n\n## Motivation\n\nRequirements for iOS apps have become huge. Our code has to manage a lot of state e.g. server responses, cached data, UI state, routing etc. Some may say that Reactive Programming can help us a lot but, in the wrong hands, it can do even more harm to your code base.\n\nThe goal of this library is to provide a simple and intuitive approach to designing reactive state machines.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### State \n\n`State` is the single source of truth. It represents a state of your system and is usually a plain Swift type. Your state is immutable. The only way to transition from one `State` to another is to emit an `Event`.\n\n### Event\n\nRepresents all possible events that can happen in your system which can cause a transition to a new `State`.\n\n### Reducer \n\nA Reducer is a pure function with a signature of `( inout State, Event) -> Void`. While `Event` represents an action that results in a `State` change, it's actually not what _causes_ the change. An `Event` is just that, a representation of the intention to transition from one state to another. What actually causes the `State` to change, the embodiment of the corresponding `Event`, is a Reducer. A Reducer is the only place where a `State` can be changed.\n\n### Feedback\n\nWhile `State` represents where the system is at a given time, `Event` represents a state change, and a `Reducer` is the pure function that enacts the event causing the state to change, there is not as of yet any type to decide which event should take place given a particular current state. That's the job of the `Feedback`. It's essentially a \"processing engine\", listening to changes in the current `State` and emitting the corresponding next events to take place. Feedbacks don't directly mutate states. Instead, they only emit events which then cause states to change in reducers.\n\nTo some extent it's like reactive [Middleware](https://redux.js.org/advanced/middleware) in [Redux](https://redux.js.org)\n\n### Dependency\n\nDependency is the type that holds all services that feature needs, such as API clients, analytics clients, etc.\n\n#### Store\n\nStore - is a base class responsible for initializing a UI state machine. It provides two ways to interact with it. \n\n- We can start a state machine by observing `var state: AnyPublisher<State, Never>`. \n- We can send input events into it via `public final func send(event: Event)`. \n\nThis is useful if we want to mutate our state in response to user input. Let's consider a `Counter` example\n\n```swift\nstruct State {\n    var count = 0\n}\n\nenum Event {\n    case increment\n    case decrement\n}\n```\nWhen we press **+** button we want the `State` of the system to be incremented by `1`. To do that somewhere in our UI we can do:\n\n```swift\nButton(action: {\n    store.send(event: .increment)\n}) {\n    return Text(\"+\").font(.largeTitle)\n}\n```\n\nAlso, we can use the `send(event:)` method to initiate side effects. For example, imagine that we are building an infinite list, and we want to trigger the next batch load when a user reaches the end of the list. \n\n```swift\nenum Event {\n    case didLoad(Results)\n    case didFail(Error)\n    case fetchNext\n}\n\nstruct State: Builder {\n    var batch: Results\n    var movies: [Movie]\n    var status: Status\n}\nenum Status {\n    case idle\n    case loading\n    case failed(Error)\n}\n\nstruct MoviesView: View {\n    typealias State = MoviesViewModel.State\n    typealias Event = MoviesViewModel.Event\n    let context: Context<State, Event>\n\n    var body: some View {\n        List {\n            ForEach(context.movies.identified(by: \\.id)) { movie in\n                MovieCell(movie: movie).onAppear {\n                // When we reach the end of the list\n                // we send `fetchNext` event\n                    if self.context.movies.last == movie {\n                        self.context.send(event: .fetchNext)\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nWhen we send `.fetchNext` event, it goes to the `reducer` where we put our system into `.loading`  state, which in response triggers effect in the `whenLoading` feedback, which is reacting to particular state changes\n\n```swift\n    static func reducer(state: inout State, event: Event) {\n        switch event {\n        case .didLoad(let batch):\n            state.movies += batch.results\n            state.status = .idle\n            state.batch = batch\n        case .didFail(let error):\n            state.status = .failed(error)\n        case .retry:\n            state.status = .loading\n        case .fetchNext:\n            state.status = .loading\n        }\n    }\n\n    static var feedback: Feedback<State, Event> {\n        return Feedback(lensing: { $0.nextPage }) { page in\n            URLSession.shared\n                .fetchMovies(page: page)\n                .map(Event.didLoad)\n                .replaceError(replace: Event.didFail)\n                .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n#### Composition\n\nTaking inspiration from [TCA](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) `CombineFeedback` is build with a composition in mind.\n\nMeaning that we can compose smaller states into bigger states. For more details please see Example App.\n\n#### ViewContext\n\n`ViewContext<State, Event>` - is a rendering context that we can use to interact with UI and render information. Via  `@dynamicMemberLookup` it has all of the properties of the `State` and several conveniences methods for more seamless integration with SwiftUI. (Credits to [@andersio](https://github.com/andersio))\n\n```swift\nstruct State  {\n    var email = \"\"\n    var password = \"\"\n}\nenum Event {\n\tcase signIn\n}\nstruct SignInView: View {\n    private let store: Store<State, Event>\n    \n    init(store: Store<State, Event>) {\n        self.store = store\n    }\n    \n    var body: some View {\n      WithContextView(store: store) { context in\n        Form {\n            Section {\n                TextField(context.binding(for: \\.email, event: Event.emailDidChange))\n                TextField(context.binding(for: \\.password, event: Event.passwordDidCange))\n                Button(action: context.action(for: .signIn)) {\n                    Text(\"Sign In\")\n                }\n            }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Example\n\n| Counter | Infinite List | SignIn Form | Traffic Light |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|<img src=\"diagrams/counter.gif\" width=\"250\"/> | <img src=\"diagrams/movies.gif\" width=\"250\"/> | <img src=\"diagrams/signin.png\" width=\"250\"/> | <img src=\"diagrams/traffic_light.gif\" width=\"250\"/> \n\n\n### References\n\n[Automata theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory)\n[TCA](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture)\n[Finite-state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)\n[Mealy machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealy_machine)\n"

For more information see [Apple CloudKit documentation](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/index.html)\n\nThis is a library to simplify the access to Apple's CloudKit data and notifications (see a more detailed description below)\n \n- EVCloudKitDao.swift for if you want control over your in app data and notifications. \n- EVCloudData.swift will let you handle CloudKit data as easy as possible. \n- EVglobal.swift for a couple of easy to use global bridging functions (EVLog and EVtry)\n\nThere is a dependency with [EVReflection](https://github.com/evermeer/EVReflection) This will automatically be setup if you are using cocoapods.\n- [EVReflection](https://github.com/evermeer/EVReflection) for if you want easy to use reflection methods. (not only for CloudKit)\n\nSee the Quick Help info for method descriptions or the documentation at [cocoadocs.org](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/EVCloudKitDao/)\n\nThe AppMessage demo is a complete functional messaging app based on CloudKit:\n\n- News items are fully functional. Just try adding, deleting and updating newsitems from the CloudKit dashboard. \n- The Contacts list based on your phone contacts that also have installed the app. \n- Chat with someone using text messages, pictures and sending your location\n- A search window (async autocomplete) where you can search all chat messages using a tokenized or begiswith query\n- It also has TestViewController.swift for an overview of the functionality\n\nI'm looking for feedback. Please let me know if you want something changed or added to the library or the demo.\n\n\n## A picture says more than 1000 words\nHere are screenshots of the included demo app chat functionality:\n\n![Screenshot0](https://github.com/evermeer/EVCloudKitDao/blob/master/Screenshots/Screenshot.png?raw=true)\n![Screenshot1](https://github.com/evermeer/EVCloudKitDao/blob/master/Screenshots/Screenshot2.png?raw=true)\n\n\n![Screenshot2](https://github.com/evermeer/EVCloudKitDao/blob/master/Screenshots/Screenshot3.PNG?raw=true)\n![Screenshot3](https://github.com/evermeer/EVCloudKitDao/blob/master/Screenshots/Screenshot4.PNG?raw=true)\n\n## Documentation ##\nDocumentation is now available at [cocoadocs.org](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/EVCloudKitDao/)\n\n\n## Main features of EVCloudKitDao:\n- simple singleton access to your public or private database and containers (default and named)\n- Object mapping: You do not have to parse from and to CKRecord (mapping is based on reflection, including system fields)\n- Generic and simplified query handling\n- Error handling (separate completionHandler and errorHandler code blocks)\n- Storing CKReference objects\n- Storing CKAsset objects\n- Optionally auto continue reading from cursor (batch query)\n- Organising subscription\n- Handling incoming notifications\n- (Re)setting the badge\n\n## Main features of EVCloudData:\n- Use just one predicate for a query, subscription and processing incoming notifications.\n- it's only one method call with a couple of callback events (optional which to use)\n- it will store the fetched data collection in memory.\n- notifications will update the data collections and call the appropriate events.\n- local updates will also update the data collection and call the appropriate events\n- since all data is processed all callback events will be executed on the mainQueue\n- caching of the results to a file for speedy app restart. (You can set the caching strategy) \n- Internal app notifications using NSNotificationCenter\n\n## Main features of EVglobal\n- EVLog as a replacement for NSLog which will also output the file, function and line number.\n\n## Known issues (Swift limitations) ##\n- If you add a property to your object of type CKReference, then also add a property of type String for the RecordID.recordName. You could add a setter for populating both properties. Then if you query this using a NSPredicate, then query the string field and not the CKReference field. You have to do this because a NSPredicate works difrently for NSCloudkit than for an object. The EVCloudData class needs them to function in the same way. For a sample, see the Message class.\n\n- Optional objects properties can now be used. Optional type properties not. Swift is not able to do a .setValue forKey on an optional like Int? or Double? As a workaround for this you could use a NSNumber? This limitation is part of [EVReflection](https://github.com/evermeer/EVReflection)\n\n## External components for the demo\nThe AppMessage demo is using the following components which can be installed using CocoaPods. See instructions below.\nBecause of dependency compatibility the AppMessage demo requires Xcode 6.2 or later.\n\n- [EVReflection](https://github.com/evermeer/EVReflection) - Swift helper library with reflection functions\n- [SSASideMenu](https://github.com/SSA111/SSASideMenu) - A Swift implementation of RESideMenu\n- [JSQMessagesViewController](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController) - An elegant messages UI library\n- [JSQSystemSoundPlayer](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQSystemSoundPlayer) - A fancy Obj-C wrapper for iOS System Sound Services\n- [CRToast](https://github.com/cruffenach/CRToast) - A modern iOS toast view that can fit your notification needs\n- [UIImage-Resize](https://github.com/AliSoftware/UIImage-Resize) - Category to add some resizing methods to the UIImage class, to resize it to a given CGSize \u2014 or fit in a CGSize keeping aspect ratio\n- [SwiftLocation](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftLocation) - iOS CoreLocation Wrapper made in Swift\n- [UzysAssetsPickerController](https://github.com/uzysjung/UzysAssetsPickerController) - Alternative UIImagePickerController , You can take a picture with camera and choose multiple photos and videos\n- [VIPhotoView](https://github.com/vitoziv/VIPhotoView) - View a photo with simple and basic interactive gesture\n- [Async](https://github.com/duemunk/Async) Syntactic sugar in Swift for asynchronous dispatches in Grand Central Dispatch\n- [PermissionScope](https://github.com/nickoneill/PermissionScope) - Intelligent iOS permissions UI and unified API\n\nBesides these the dependency to EVCloudKitDao has been skipped by just using the classes directly\n- [EVCloudKitDao](https://github.com/evermeer/EVCloudKitDao) - Simplified access to Apple's CloudKit\n\n\n## Using EVCloudKitDao or EVCloudData in your own App \n\n'EVCloudKitDao' is now available through the dependency manager [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). \nYou do have to use cocoapods version 0.36. At this moment this can be installed by executing:\n\n```\n[sudo] gem install cocoapods\n```\n\nIf you have installed cocoapods version 0.36 or later, then you can just add EVCloudKitDao to your workspace by adding the folowing 2 lines to your Podfile:\n\n```ruby\nuse_frameworks!\npod \"EVCloudKitDao\"\n```\n\nI have now moved on to Swift 2. If you want to use EVCloudKitDao with Swift 1.2, then get that version by using the podfile command:\n```ruby\nuse_frameworks!\npod 'EVReflection', :git => 'https://github.com/evermeer/EVReflection.git', :branch => 'Swift1.2'\npod 'SwiftTryCatch'\npod 'EVCloudKitDao', '~> 2.6'\n```\n\n\nVersion 0.36 of cocoapods will make a dynamic framework of all the pods that you use. Because of that it's only supported in iOS 8.0 or later. When using a framework, you also have to add an import at the top of your swift file like this:\n\n```swift\nimport EVCloudKitDao\n```\n\nIf you want support for older versions than iOS 8.0, then you can also just copy the Cloudkit folder containing the 5 classes EVCloudKitDao, EVCloudData, EVReflection, EVCloudData and EVglobal to your app.\n\nWhen you have added EVCloudKitDao to your project, then have a look at the AppMessage code for how to implement push notifications and how to connect to CloudKit data (see AppDelegate.swift and LeftMenuViewController.swift) For contacts see the RightMenuViewController.swift and for other usage see the TestsViewController.swift\n\n\n## Building the AppMessage demo\n\n1) Clone the repo to a working directory\n\n2) [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is used to manage dependencies. Pods are setup easily and are distributed via a ruby gem. Follow the simple instructions on the website to setup. After setup, run the following command from the toplevel directory of AppMessage to download the dependencies for AppMessage:\n\n```sh\npod install\n```\n\n3) Open the `AppMessage.xcworkspace` in Xcode.\n\n4) Go to AppMessage target settings and update the:\n\n- bundle name (usually your own reversed domain)\n- Change the team settings (your own certificate that is enabled for push notifications)\n- fix the iCloud capabilities. (check key-value store and CloudKit with a default container)\n- fix the capabilities for Background Modes 'Background fetch' and 'Remote notifications'\n\n5) Build and Run the app. In the AppDelegate there is a call to initiate all objects (createRecordTypes). All required CloudKit objects will be created.\n\n6) Open the CloudKit dashboard, select all recordtypes and enable all 'Metadata Indexes'\n\n7) Disable the call to .createRecordTypes in AppDelegate and run the app again.\n\n8) Make sure you run the app on 2 devices, each using a diverent iCloud account and each device having the other account in it's contact list.\n\n\nand you are ready to go!\n\n## How to use the EVCloudData\nBelow is all the code you need to setup a news feed including push notification handling for any changes.\n\n\n```swift\n// Just enherit from CKDataObject so that you have access to the CloudKit metadata\nclass News : CKDataObject {\n    var Subject : String = \"\"\n    var Text : String = \"\"\n}\n\nclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {\n    var window: UIWindow?\n\n    func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: NSDictionary?) -> Bool {\n        // Make sure we receive subscription notifications\n        application.registerUserNotificationSettings(UIUserNotificationSettings(forTypes: .Alert | .Badge | .Sound, categories: nil))\n        application.registerForRemoteNotifications()\n        return true\n    }\n\n    func application(application: UIApplication!, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [NSObject : NSObject]!) {\n        EVLog(\"Push received\")\n        EVCloudData.publicDB.didReceiveRemoteNotification(userInfo, {\n            EVLog(\"Not a CloudKit Query notification.\")            \n        })\n    }\n\n    func applicationDidEnterBackground(application: UIApplication) {\n        // If you do a backup then this backup will be reloaded after app restart.\n        EVCloudData.publicDB.backupData()        \n    }\n}\n\n\nclass LeftMenuViewController: UIViewController {\n    var newsController: NewsViewController!\n\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        connectToNews()\n        // Only already setup CloudKit connect's will receive these notifications (like the News above)\n        EVCloudData.publicDB.fetchChangeNotifications()        \n    }\n\n    deinit {\n        EVCloudData.publicDB.disconnect(\"News_All\")\n    }\n\n    func connectToNews() {\n        EVCloudData.publicDB.connect(News()\n        , predicate: NSPredicate(value: true)\n        , filterId: \"News_All\"\n        , configureNotificationInfo: { notificationInfo in\n            notificationInfo.alertBody = \"New news item\"\n            notificationInfo.shouldSendContentAvailable = true }\n        , completionHandler: { results in\n            EVLog(\"There are \\(results.count) existing news items\")\n            self.newsController.tableView.reloadData()\n            return results.count < 200 // Continue reading if we have less than 200 records and if there are more.\n        }, insertedHandler: {item in\n            Helper.showStatus(\"New News item: '\\(item.Subject)'\")\n            self.newsController.tableView.reloadData()\n        }, updatedHandler: {item in\n            Helper.showStatus(\"Updated News item:'\\(item.Subject)'\")\n            self.newsController.tableView.reloadData()\n        }, deletedHandler: {recordId in\n            Helper.showStatus(\"News item was removed\")\n            self.newsController.tableView.reloadData()\n        }, dataChangedHandler : {\n            EVLog(\"Some News data was changed\")\n        }, errorHandler: {error in\n            Helper.showError(\"Could not load news: \\(error.description)\")\n        })\n    }\n}\n\n\nclass NewsViewController : UIViewController, UITableViewDataSource, UITableViewDelegate, RESideMenuDelegate {\n\t...\n    func tableView(tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {\n        var cell:UITableViewCell! = tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier(cellIdentifier) as?

You should handle the error appropriate. There is a helper function for getting a functional error status. In most cases you would get something like the code below. When you are doing data manupilations you should also handle the .RecoverableError\n\n```swift\nfunc initializeCommunication(retryCount: Double = 1) {\n    ...\n    }, errorHandler: { error in\n        switch EVCloudKitDao.handleCloudKitErrorAs(error, retryAttempt: retryCount) {\n            case .Retry(let timeToWait):\n                Async.background(after: timeToWait) {\n                    self.initializeCommunication(retryCount: retryCount + 1)\n                }\n            case .Fail:\n                if error.code == .limitExceeded {\n                    //TODO: try again with a smaller load?\n                }            \n                Helper.showError(\"Could not load messages: \\(error.localizedDescription)\")\n            default: // For here there is no need to handle the .Success, and .RecoverableError\n                break\n        }\n    })\n}\n```\n\n\n## License\n\nEVCloudKitDao is available under the MIT license.

Now this problem is fixed, if the Sonoff does not have a WIFI Connection every 10min the Sonoff will restart.\n\n### Selectable PowerOn state\nBy default the Sonoff will have a Enabled state at power on, you can change this by selecting \"OFF\" in the `flash.sh` script\n\n---\n\n## Installation Instructions\n\n### Flash the Sonoff\n 1) Unplug your sonoff from the power line _(or you can burn your PC)_\n 2) Connect your Sonoff to a serial adapter @ 3.3v\n 3) Run the `flash.sh` script \n\n### Add Sonoff to Home app\n 1) Connect your iPhone or iPad to the new wifi network `Sonoff Switch-xxx`\n 2) Wait for the Captive Portal and select your WiFi network\n 3) Insert your WiFi Password\n 4) Open the `Home` app\n 5) Click the `+` symbol\n 6) Click `I don't have the code...`\n 7) Select the Sonoff-xxx Switch \n 7.1 If the Sonoff-xxx does not appear on top of the page try to press the sonoff button a couple of times and kill the Home App\n 9) Confirm that you want to add the Sonoff\n 10) Insert the Password that is `11111111`\n\nDone! \ud83c\udf89 \n\n## If you like this project please:\n\n<a href=\"https://bmc.xyz/l/SonoffHomekit\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gruppio/Sonoff-Homekit/images/images/buymeacoffee.png\" alt=\"Buy Me A Coffee\" width=\"300\" ></a>\n\nMy supporters will also receive immediately:\n\n* A **Step-by-Step Video Tutorial** that will help you to flash and connect your Sonoff\n* A personal **E-Mail** where you can write to me your Issues\n\n---\n\n#### Special thanks to:\n@maximkulkin\n\nThis project would not have existed without:\nhttps://github.com/maximkulkin/esp-homekit\nhttps://github.com/maximkulkin/esp-homekit-demo\nhttps://github.com/maximkulkin/esp-wifi-config\n\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Tasty Imitation Keyboard\n\nI'm working on a 3rd party keyboard for iOS8 and I want it to look and feel as close as possible to Apple's keyboard. Unfortunately, it's not possible to access the keyboard view through code, so this is my attempt to imitate it by hand. (I'm sure there are ways to get even more accuracy via reverse engineering, but that's too much work for me!) In the end, I hope to produce a coherent and robust baseline for creating custom 3rd party keybards \u2014 at least, until Apple decides to fully open up their keyboard API.\n\nThis keyboard is currently optimized for iPhone. iPad should work, but it'll look like a giant iPhone keyboard.\n\n## Recent Screenshots\n\n<img style=\"border: gray 1px solid;\" width=\"320px\" src=\"./Screenshot-Portrait.png\"></img>\n<img style=\"border: gray 1px solid;\" width=\"568px\" src=\"./Screenshot-Landscape.png\"></img>\n<img style=\"border: gray 1px solid;\" width=\"320px\" src=\"./Settings-Portrait.png\"></img>\n\n## Fantastic Features\n\n* No bitmaps! Everything is rendered using CoreGraphics.\n* Dynamic layouts! All the keys are laid out programmatically, meaning that the keyboard is much easier to extend and will automatically work on devices of all sizes.\n* Auto-capitalization, period shortcut, keyboard clicks.\n* An extensible settings screen.\n* Dark mode and solid color mode.\n* This keyboard is an iOS8 extension.\n\n## Current State\n\nWe are in alpha! The basic features and appearance should all be there by now. I'll try to not commit broken builds anymore.\n\nGood news! [I now have an app in the App Store that's built on top of this keyboard](http://translit-keyboard.archagon.net), so we know that it can pass the App Store review process.\n\nHold-to-select-alternate-characters will be implemented at a later time.\n\n## Build Instructions\n\n1. Edit Scheme for the Keyboard target and set the Executable to be HostingApp.app.\n2. Run the Keyboard target.\n3. Go to `Settings \u2192 General \u2192 Keyboard \u2192 Keyboards \u2192 Add New Keyboard` on your device and add the third-party keyboard.\n4. Go back to the app. You should be able to select the keyboard via the globe icon.\n\n## Learning Goals\n\n* Swift\n* 3rd party extensions\n* 3rd party frameworks (for IB use)\n* Autolayout\n* CoreGraphics\n* finally release an app on the App Store, darn it\n\n## Other Stuff\n\nPlease consult [the project wiki](https://github.com/archagon/tasty-imitation-keyboard/wiki) for technical details. You may find it handy if you're implementing your own keyboard!\n\nI made a 3rd party functionless keyboard with a similar layout but a much simpler program structure for debugging purposes. You can find it here: [faux-testing-keyboard](https://github.com/archagon/faux-testing-keyboard)\n\n\ud83d\ude40 **Please forgive the *incredibly confusing* code in some of the classes. I started out trying to be all neat and perfect, but a self-imposed deadline for a personal project forced me to barge forward closer to release. And you know how that goes...** \ud83d\ude40\n\nFinally, keep in mind that I am not a framework maintainer nor intend to become one. This release is public and open source because I have no reason to keep it private, not because I wish to improve it for years on end (though I still may). Expect work on this project to be sporadic at best. If you wish to use this in production, rather than waiting on me, I strongly encourage you to fork.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the 3-clause (\"New\") BSD license. Go Bears!"

  "readme_contents": "## Apple Watch Plugin for Apache Cordova [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/cordova-plugin-apple-watch.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/cordova-plugin-apple-watch)\n\n**Cordova / PhoneGap Plugin for the Apple Watch (WatchKit) to allow communication between a Cordova app and an Apple WatchKit Extension (and vice versa).**\n\nSimplified overarching diagram for message passing:\n\n<img align=\"center\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leecrossley/cordova-plugin-apple-watch/master/apple-watch-plugin.png\">\n\nYou will need to write your own WatchKit Extension and WatchKit app with native code. It is not possible to run a Cordova app directly on the Watch, as there is no support for a WebView and the WatchKit code must reside in the WatchKit Extension. This plugin provides various methods of communication between a Cordova iPhone app and the WatchKit Extension / app.\n\nFor more information on developing your WatchKit Extension / app, please see the [WatchKit Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/WatchKitProgrammingGuide/).\n\n### Supported methods of communication:\n\n- **[Message passing](#message-passing)** - in memory and lightweight json object message passing over named queues between a Cordova app and a WatchKit Extension (2-way)\n- **[Local notifications](#notifications)** - sending notifications directly from a Cordova app to an Apple Watch\n- **[User defaults](#user-defaults)** - persisting user data accessible by both a Cordova app and a WatchKit Extension\n\n*Please note that you cannot force a Cordova app to open from the Apple Watch - this is a limitation set by Apple.*\n\n## Install\n\n#### Latest published version on npm (with Cordova CLI >= 5.0.0)\n\n```\ncordova plugin add cordova-plugin-apple-watch\n```\n\n#### Latest version from GitHub\n\n```\ncordova plugin add https://github.com/leecrossley/cordova-plugin-apple-watch.git\n```\n\nYou **do not** need to reference any JavaScript, the Cordova plugin architecture will add a `applewatch` object to your root automatically when you build.\n\n## Message passing\n\nSome success and error handlers may be omitted. This is catered for in the interface function argument orders.\n\n### init\n\nInitialises the Apple Watch two way messaging interface. This must be called and the success handler fired before `sendMessage` can be used.\n\n```js\napplewatch.init(function successHandler(appGroupId) {}, errorHandler);\n```\n\nThe `successHandler` is called with one arg `appGroupId` that was used in initialisation. The app bundleId will be used for identification by default, prefixed by \"group.\".\n\nYou can supply your own Application Group Id with the optional `appGroupId` argument, this should be in the format \"group.com.company.app\":\n\n```js\napplewatch.init(successHandler, errorHandler, appGroupId);\n```\n\n### sendMessage\n\nSends a message object to a specific queue (must be called after successful init).\n\nUsed to send strings or json objects to the Apple Watch extension. Json objects are automatically stringified.\n\nThe value of `queueName` must match a value used in a corresponding listener in Swift or Objective-C within the watch app using the method `MMWormhole.listenForMessageWithIdentifier` in order for the watch to receive the sent message.\n\n```js\napplewatch.sendMessage(message, queueName, successHandler, errorHandler);\n```\n\n### addListener\n\nAdds a listener to handle a message object received on a specific queue (must be called after successful init).\n\nUsed to handle strings or json objects received from the Apple Watch extension. Json objects are automatically parsed. \n\nThe value of `queueName` must be used in a corresponding `MMWormhole.passMessageObject` method in Swift or Objective-C within the watch app in order for the Cordova app to receive a message.\n\n```js\napplewatch.addListener(queueName, messageHandler);\n```\n\n### removeListener\n\nRemoves a listener for a specific queue.\n\n```js\napplewatch.removeListener(queueName, successHandler, errorHandler);\n```\n\n### purgeQueue\n\n**Use with caution**: removes all messages on a queue.\n\n```js\napplewatch.purgeQueue(queueName, successHandler, errorHandler);\n```\n\n### purgeAllQueues\n\n**Use with extreme caution**: removes all messages on all queues.\n\n```js\napplewatch.purgeAllQueues(successHandler, errorHandler);\n```\n\n### Message passing examples\n\nExample to send a message \"test\" to the \"myqueue\" queue and get handled, where \"com.yourcompany\" is the App ID and \"group.com.yourcompany\" is the [App Group](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AddingCapabilities/AddingCapabilities.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH26-SW61).\n\n#### Initialise message passing (Cordova app, js)\n\n```js\napplewatch.init(function (appGroupId) {\n    // success, messages may now be sent or listened for\n}, function (err) {\n    // an error occurred\n},\n\"group.com.yourcompany\");\n```\n\n#### Send a message (Cordova app, js)\n\n```js\n// assumes a previously successful init call (above)\n\napplewatch.sendMessage(\"test\", \"from_phone_queue\");\n```\n\n#### Listen for messages (Cordova app, js)\n\n```js\n// assumes a previously successful init call (above)\n\napplewatch.addListener(\"from_watch_queue\", function (message) {\n    // handle your message here\n});\n```\n\n#### Initialise message passing (WatchKit extension, swift)\n\n```swift\n// assumes your WatchKit extension references Wormhole.h in a Bridging-Header.h file\n\nlet watchConnectivityListeningWormhole = MMWormholeSession.sharedListeningSession();\nwatchConnectivityListeningWormhole.activateSessionListening();\n\nlet wormhole = MMWormhole(applicationGroupIdentifier: \"group.com.yourcompany\", optionalDirectory: nil, transitingType: .SessionContext);\n\n```\n\n#### Send a message (WatchKit extension, swift)\n\n```swift\n// assumes wormhole is initialised (above)\n\nwormhole.passMessageObject(\"titleString\", identifier: \"from_watch_queue\")\n```\n\n#### Listen for messages (WatchKit extension, swift)\n\n```swift\n// assumes wormhole is initialised (above)\n\nwatchConnectivityListeningWormhole.listenForMessageWithIdentifier(\"from_phone_queue\", listener: { (messageObject) -> Void in\n    if let message: AnyObject = messageObject {\n        // handle your message here\n    }\n})\n```\n\nMore information regarding the MMWormhole component used in message passing can be found [here](https://github.com/mutualmobile/MMWormhole).\n\n## Notifications\n\n### registerNotifications\n\nRequests permission for local notifications if you want to utilise the short-look / long-look notification interface. This must be called and the success handler fired before `sendNotification` will work correctly.\n\n```js\napplewatch.registerNotifications(successHandler, errorHandler);\n```\n\n- successHandler is called with **true** if the permission was accepted\n- errorHandler is called with **false** if the permission was rejected\n\n### sendNotification\n\nSends a local notification directly to the Apple Watch (should be called after successful registerNotifications).\n\nUsed to display the Apple Watch short-look / long-look notification interface, using UILocalNotification. If the user continues to look at the notification, the system transitions quickly from the short-look interface to the long-look interface.\n\n```js\nvar payload = {\n    \"title\": \"Short!\",\n    \"category\": \"default\",\n    \"body\": \"Shown in the long-look interface to provide more detail\",\n    \"badge\": 1\n};\n\napplewatch.sendNotification(successHandler, errorHandler, payload);\n```\n\n- *title* - shown in the short-look interface as a brief indication of the intent of the notification\n- *category* - defines the notification interface to show and action buttons (if any)\n- *body* - shown in the long-look interface to provide more detail\n- *badge* - app icon badge number\n\nNB: This notification will also appear on the iPhone if the app is running in a background mode.\n\n## User defaults\n\n### sendUserDefaults\n\nAllows persistence of user default data (single property key/value object) that can be retrieved by the WatchKit extension.\n\n```js\napplewatch.sendUserDefaults(successHandler,\n    errorHandler, { \"myKey\": \"myValue\" }, appGroupId);\n```\n\nThe app bundleId will be used for identification by default, prefixed by \"group.\" if `appGroupId` is not supplied.\n\nFor completeness, here's how you could retrieve the value in your WatchKit extension (swift):\n\n```swift\nlet userDefaults = NSUserDefaults(suiteName: \"group.com.yourcompany\")\n\nvar myValue: String? {\n    userDefaults?.synchronize()\n    return userDefaults?.stringForKey(\"myKey\")\n}\n```\n\n### getUserDefaults\n\nAllows retrieval of user default data.\n\n```js\napplewatch.getUserDefaults(successHandler, errorHandler, \"myKey\", appGroupId);\n```\n\nThe app bundleId will be used for identification by default, prefixed by \"group.\" if `appGroupId` is not supplied.\n\n## Live demo\n\nSee this plugin working in a live app: [sprint.social](http://sprint.social)\n\n## Platforms\n\niOS 8.2+ only. However, you can include this plugin and set a lower minimum iOS version. For example setting a deployment target of 8.0 will not cause any errors with the plugin. Similarly, there will be no errors if a user is using the Cordova app without a paired watch.\n\nwatchOS 1 & 2.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT License](http://ilee.mit-license.org)\n"

Keep in mind that you have to store this in your database at this time! For every login after that, Apple will provide you with a unique ID that you can use to lookup the username in your database.\n\n## Example\n\n**Live on https://passport-apple.ananay.dev**\n\n**Example repo: https://github.com/ananay/passport-apple-example**\n\n## Installation\nInstall the package via npm / yarn:\n``` npm install --save passport-apple ```\n\nYou will also need to install & configure `body-parser` if using Express:\n``` npm install --save body-parser ```\n\n```js\nconst bodyParser = require(\"body-parser\");\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));\n```\n\nNext, you need to configure your Apple Developer Account with Sign in with Apple.\n\nSteps for that are given here:\nhttps://github.com/ananay/apple-auth/blob/master/SETUP.md\n\n## Usage\n\nInitialize the strategy as follows:\n\n```js\nconst AppleStrategy = require('passport-apple');\npassport.use(new AppleStrategy({\n    clientID: \"\",\n    teamID: \"\",\n    callbackURL: \"\",\n    keyID: \"\",\n    privateKeyLocation: \"\",\n    passReqToCallback: true\n}, function(req, accessToken, refreshToken, idToken, profile, cb) {\n    // The idToken returned is encoded. You can use the jsonwebtoken library via jwt.decode(idToken)\n    // to access the properties of the decoded idToken properties which contains the user's\n    // identity information.\n    // Here, check if the idToken.sub exists in your database!\n    // idToken should contains email too if user authorized it but will not contain the name\n    // `profile` parameter is REQUIRED for the sake of passport implementation\n    // it should be profile in the future but apple hasn't implemented passing data\n    // in access token yet https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple/tokenresponse\n    cb(null, idToken);\n}));\n```\nAdd the login route:\n```js\napp.get(\"/login\", passport.authenticate('apple'));\n```\n\nFinally, add the callback route and handle the response:\n```js\napp.post(\"/auth\", function(req, res, next) {\n    passport.authenticate('apple', function(err, user, info) {\n        if (err) {\n            if (err == \"AuthorizationError\") {\n                res.send(\"Oops! Looks like you didn't allow the app to proceed. Please sign in again! <br /> \\\n                <a href=\\\"/login\\\">Sign in with Apple</a>\");\n            } else if (err == \"TokenError\") {\n                res.send(\"Oops! Couldn't get a valid token from Apple's servers! <br /> \\\n                <a href=\\\"/login\\\">Sign in with Apple</a>\");\n            }\n        } else {\n            res.json(user);\n        }\n    })(req, res, next);\n});\n```\n\n## Other Sign in with Apple repos\n\nCheck out my other sign in with Apple Repos here.\n\n```apple-auth```:\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ananay/apple-auth\">https://github.com/ananay/apple-auth</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://npmjs.com/package/apple-auth\">https://npmjs.com/package/apple-auth</a>\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### What's the difference between `apple-auth` and `passport-apple`?\n`apple-auth` is a standalone library for Sign in with Apple. It does not require you to use Passport.js where as passport-apple is used with Passport.js.\n\n#### \u26a0\ufe0f Legal Disclaimer\nThis repository is NOT developed, endorsed by Apple Inc. or even related at all to Apple Inc. This library was implemented solely by the community's hardwork, and based on information that is public on Apple Developer's website. The library merely acts as a helper tool for anyone trying to implement Apple's Sign in with Apple.\n\n#### How is this module different from [nicokaiser/passport-apple](https://github.com/nicokaiser/passport-apple)?\n`@nicokaiser/passport-apple` is a fork of `passport-apple` that was made when `passport-apple` couldn't support fetching profile information. `passport-apple` now **supports** fetching profile information as well by using a simpler workaround (shoutout to [@MotazAbuElnasr](https://github.com/MotazAbuElnasr) for this!) instead of rewriting all of `passport-oauth2`.\n\n## Questions / Contributing\n\nFeel free to open issues and pull requests. If you would like to be one of the core creators of this library, please reach out to me at i@ananayarora.com or message me on twitter @ananayarora!\n\n<h4> Created with \u2764\ufe0f by <a href=\"https://ananayarora.com\">Ananay Arora</a></h4>\n"

If you'd like to support this, and our other packages, please consider sponsoring us via the button above.\n\nWe thank the following sponsors for their generosity, please take a moment to check them out:\n\n- [LIX](https://lix-it.com)\n\n## Table of Contents\n- [Requirements](#Requirements)\n- [Installation](#Installation)\n- [Configuration](#Configuration)\n- [Implementation](#Implementation)\n  - [Button](#Button)\n  - [Controller](#Controller)\n\n<a name=\"Requirements\"></a>\n## Requirements\n\n- PHP 7.3+\n- Laravel 8.0+\n- Socialite 5.0+\n- Apple Developer Subscription\n\n<a name=\"Installation\"></a>\n## Installation\n\n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/366353988\">![siwa-video-cover](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1791050/66785970-af4a5c00-ee93-11e9-9470-b42af6f237c9.png)</a>\n\n1. Install the composer package:\n    ```sh\n    composer require genealabs/laravel-sign-in-with-apple\n    ```\n\n    We also recommend using [geneaLabs/laravel-socialiter](https://github.com/GeneaLabs/laravel-socialiter)\n    to automatically manage user resolution and persistence:\n\n    ```sh\n    composer require genealabs/laravel-socialiter\n    ```\n\n<a name=\"Configuration\"></a>\n## Configuration\n\n1. Create an `App ID` for your website (https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/bundleId) with the following details:\n    - Platform: iOS, tvOS, watchOS (I'm unsure if either choice has an effect for web apps)\n    - Description: (something like \"example.com app id\")\n    - Bundle ID (Explicit): com.example.id (or something similar)\n    - Check \"Sign In With Apple\"\n2. Create a `Service ID` for your website (https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/serviceId) with the following details:\n    - Description: (something like \"example.com service id\")\n    - Identifier: com.example.service (or something similar)\n    - Check \"Sign In With Apple\"\n    - Configure \"Sign In With Apple\":\n        - Primary App Id: (select the primary app id created in step 1)\n        - Web Domain: example.com (the domain of your web site)\n        - Return URLs: https://example.com/apple-signin (the route pointing to the callback method in your controller)\n        - Click \"Save\".\n        - Click the \"Edit\" button to edit the details of the \"Sign In With Apple\"\n            configuration we just created.\n        - If you haven't verified the domain yet, download the verification file,\n            upload it to https://example.com/.well-known/apple-developer-domain-association.txt, and then click the \"Verify\"\n            button.\n3. Create a `Private Key` for your website (https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list) with the following details:\n    - Key Name: \n    - Check \"Sign In With Apple\"\n    - Configure \"Sign In With Apple\":\n        - Primary App ID: (select the primary app id created in step 1)\n        - Click \"Save\"\n    - Click \"Continue\"\n    - Click \"Register\"\n    - Click \"Download\"\n    - Rename the downloaded file to `key.txt`\n4. Create your app's client secret:\n    - Install the JWT Gem:\n        ```sh\n        sudo gem install jwt\n        ```\n    \n    - Create a file called `client_secret.rb` to process the private key:\n        ```ruby\n        require 'jwt'\n\n        key_file = 'key.txt'\n        team_id = ''\n        client_id = ''\n        key_id = ''\n\n        ecdsa_key = OpenSSL::PKey::EC.new IO.read key_file\n\n        headers = {\n        'kid' => key_id\n        }\n\n        claims = {\n            'iss' => team_id,\n            'iat' => Time.now.to_i,\n            'exp' => Time.now.to_i + 86400*180,\n            'aud' => 'https://appleid.apple.com',\n            'sub' => client_id,\n        }\n\n        token = JWT.encode claims, ecdsa_key, 'ES256', headers\n\n        puts token\n        ```\n\n    - Fill in the following fields:\n        - `team_id`: This can be found on the top-right corner when logged into\n            your Apple Developer account, right under your name.\n        - `client_id`: This is the identifier from the Service Id created in step\n            2 above, for example com.example.service\n        - `key_id`: This is the identifier of the private key created in step 3\n            above.\n    - Save the file and run it from the terminal. It will spit out a JWT which is\n        your client secret, which you will need to add to your `.env` file in the\n        next step.\n        ```sh\n        ruby client_secret.rb\n        ```\n        \n5. Set the necessary environment variables in your `.env` file:\n\n    ```env\n    SIGN_IN_WITH_APPLE_LOGIN=\"/apple/login/controller/login/action\"\n    SIGN_IN_WITH_APPLE_REDIRECT=\"/apple/login/controller/callback/action\"\n    SIGN_IN_WITH_APPLE_CLIENT_ID=\"your app's service id as registered with Apple\"\n    SIGN_IN_WITH_APPLE_CLIENT_SECRET=\"your app's client secret as calculated in step 4\"\n    ```\n\n<a name=\"Implementation\"></a>\n## Implementation\n\n<a name=\"LoginButton\"></a>\n### Button\n\nAdd the following blade directive to your login page:\n\n```php\n@signInWithApple($color, $hasBorder, $type, $borderRadius)\n```\n\n| Parameter | Definition |\n| --------- | ---------- |\n| $color    | String, either \"black\" or \"white. |\n| $hasBorder | Boolean, either `true` or `false`. |\n| $type      | String, either `\"sign-in\"` or `\"continue\"`. |\n| $borderRadius | Integer, greater or equal to 0. |\n\n<a name=\"Controller\"></a>\n### Controller\n\nThis implementation uses Socialite to get the login credentials. The following is an example implementation of the controller:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nnamespace App\\Http\\Controllers\\Auth;\n\nuse App\\Http\\Controllers\\Controller;\nuse GeneaLabs\\LaravelSocialiter\\Facades\\Socialiter;\nuse Laravel\\Socialite\\Facades\\Socialite;\n\nclass AppleSigninController extends Controller\n{\n    public function __construct()\n    {\n        $this->middleware('guest')->except('logout');\n    }\n\n    public function login()\n    {\n        return Socialite::driver(\"sign-in-with-apple\")\n            ->scopes([\"name\", \"email\"])\n            ->redirect();\n    }\n\n    public function callback(Request $request)\n    {\n        // get abstract user object, not persisted\n        $user = Socialite::driver(\"sign-in-with-apple\")\n            ->user();\n        \n        // or use Socialiter to automatically manage user resolution and persistence\n        $user = Socialiter::driver(\"sign-in-with-apple\")\n            ->login();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNote that when processing the returned `$user` object, it is critical to know that the `sub` element is the unique identifier for the user, **NOT** the email address.

Incomplete issues may be ignored or closed if there is not enough\ninformation included to be actionable.\n\n### Submitting Pull Requests\nPlease review the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/GeneaLabs/laravel-sign-in-with-apple/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Only PRs that meet all criterium will be accepted.\n\n## If you \u2764\ufe0f open-source software, give the repos you use a \u2b50\ufe0f.\nWe have included the awesome `symfony/thanks` composer package as a dev dependency. Let your OS package maintainers know you appreciate them by starring the packages you use. Simply run `composer thanks` after installing this package. (And not to worry, since it's a dev-dependency it won't be installed in your live environment.)\n"

  "readme_contents": "# m1n1: an experimentation playground for Apple Silicon\n\n(And to some extent a Linux bootloader)\n\n## Building\n\nYou need an `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc` cross-compiler toolchain (or a native one, if running on ARM64).\n\n```shell\n$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/AsahiLinux/m1n1.git\n$ cd m1n1\n$ make\n```\n\nThe output will be in build/m1n1.macho.\n\nTo build on a native arm64 machine, use `make ARCH=`.\n\nBuilding on ARM64 macOS is supported with clang and LLVM; you need to use Homebrew to\ninstall the required dependencies:\n\n```shell\n$ brew install llvm\n```\n\nAfter that, just type `make`.\n\n### Building using the container setup\n\nIf you have a container runtime installed, like Podman or Docker, you can make use of the compose setup, which contains all build dependencies.\n\n```shell\n$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/AsahiLinux/m1n1.git\n$ cd m1n1\n$ podman-compose run m1n1 make\n$ # or\n$ docker-compose run m1n1 make\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nOur [wiki](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/m1n1%3AUser-Guide) has more information on how to\nuse m1n1.\n\nTo install on an OS container based on macOS <12.1, use `m1n1.macho`:\n\n```shell\nkmutil configure-boot -c m1n1.macho -v <path to your OS volume>\n```\n\nTo install on an OS container based on macOS >=12.1, use `m1n1.bin`:\n\n```shell\nkmutil configure-boot -c m1n1.bin --raw --entry-point 2048 --lowest-virtual-address 0 -v <path to your OS volume>\n```\n\n## Payloads\n\nm1n1 supports running payloads by simple concatenation:\n\n```shell\n$ cat build/m1n1.macho Image.gz build/dtb/apple-j274.dtb initramfs.cpio.gz > m1n1-payload.macho\n$ cat build/m1n1.bin Image.gz build/dtb/apple-j274.dtb initramfs.cpio.gz > m1n1-payload.bin\n```\n\nSupported payload file formats:\n\n* Kernel images (or compatible). Must be compressed or last payload.\n* Devicetree blobs (FDT). May be uncompressed or compressed.\n* Initramfs cpio images. Must be compressed.\n\nSupported compression formats:\n\n* gzip\n* xz\n\n## License\n\nm1n1 is licensed under the MIT license, as included in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.\n\n* Copyright The Asahi Linux Contributors\n\nPlease see the Git history for authorship information.\n\nPortions of m1n1 are based on mini:\n\n* Copyright (C) 2008-2010 Hector Martin \"marcan\" <marcan@marcan.st>\n* Copyright (C) 2008-2010 Sven Peter <sven@svenpeter.dev>\n* Copyright (C) 2008-2010 Andre Heider <a.heider@gmail.com>\n\nm1n1 embeds libfdt, which is dual [BSD](3rdparty_licenses/LICENSE.BSD-2.libfdt) and\n[GPL-2](3rdparty_licenses/LICENSE.GPL-2) licensed and copyright:\n\n* Copyright (C) 2014 David Gibson <david@gibson.dropbear.id.au>\n* Copyright (C) 2018 embedded brains GmbH\n* Copyright (C) 2006-2012 David Gibson, IBM Corporation.\n* Copyright (C) 2012 David Gibson, IBM Corporation.\n* Copyright 2012 Kim Phillips, Freescale Semiconductor.\n* Copyright (C) 2016 Free Electrons\n* Copyright (C) 2016 NextThing Co.\n\nThe ADT code in mini is also based on libfdt and subject to the same license.\n\nm1n1 embeds [minlzma](https://github.com/ionescu007/minlzma), which is\n[MIT](3rdparty_licenses/LICENSE.minlzma) licensed and copyright:\n\n* Copyright (c) 2020 Alex Ionescu\n\nm1n1 embeds a slightly modified version of [tinf](https://github.com/jibsen/tinf), which is\n[ZLIB](3rdparty_licenses/LICENSE.tinf) licensed and copyright:\n\n* Copyright (c) 2003-2019 Joergen Ibsen\n\nm1n1 embeds portions taken from\n[arm-trusted-firmware](https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware), which is\n[BSD](3rdparty_licenses/LICENSE.BSD-3.arm) licensed and copyright:\n\n* Copyright (c) 2013-2020, ARM Limited and Contributors.

(Yes it actually streams them in order even though it's BitTorrent)\n\nTv.js used iTunes' API to find movies, isoHunt to search torrents and BitTorrent to downloading/stream movies.\n\nIt runs as a server which can run on a Raspberry Pi and the UI can be controlled from a smartphone (no need of keyboard or mouse).\n\nTv.js is the result of a 24h personal hackathon (7th of July 2013) by Aaron O'Mullan (@AaronO) and me (@SamyPesse).\n\nIt's designed to run on a TV screen (through HDMI), but works just as well on a laptop. (it's entirely usable with keyboard controls alone)\n\nYou can see a video of it working here on Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j71NCZnLffg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j71NCZnLffg)\n\nDownloading copyrighted material through torrents may be illegal in your country.\n\n[![Screen](https://raw.github.com/SamyPesse/tv.js/master/screens/1.png)](https://raw.github.com/SamyPesse/tv.js/master/screens/1b.png)\n\n[![Screen](https://raw.github.com/SamyPesse/tv.js/master/screens/3.png)](https://raw.github.com/SamyPesse/tv.js/master/screens/3b.png)\n\n[![Screen](https://raw.github.com/SamyPesse/tv.js/master/screens/4.png)](https://raw.github.com/SamyPesse/tv.js/master/screens/4b.png)\n\n[![Screen](https://raw.github.com/SamyPesse/tv.js/master/screens/5.png)](https://raw.github.com/SamyPesse/tv.js/master/screens/5b.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n## How to use it on your computer ?\n\nTo build and run the app, you'll need :\n\n    node\n    make\n    ffmpeg\n\thomebrew\n\n\nTo build and run the all :\n\n    make install\n    make\n\nAnd go to [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) on your browser\n\nOr simply run the server without rebuilding the client with :\n\n    make run\n\n\n## How to install it on your TV ?\n\nThis application has been built and designed to run on a TV screen using a Raspberry Pi.\nFollow [this tutorial](https://github.com/SamyPesse/tv.js/blob/master/raspberrypi/README.md) to install TV.js on your Raspberry Pi\n\n## How to install ffmpeg ?\n\ntv.js needs ffmpeg to convert the videos to ogv, make sure you have ffmpeg installed with the necessary codecs.\n\n#### Mac OS X :\n\n\truby <(curl -fsSk https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)\n\n    brew install ffmpeg --with-fdk-aac --with-ffplay --with-freetype --with-frei0r --with-libass --with-libvo-aacenc --with-libvorbis --with-libvpx --with-opencore-amr --with-openjpeg --with-opus --with-rtmpdump --with-schroedinger --with-speex --with-theora --with-tools\n\n\n## Todo\n    - Use IMBD or another API with a bigger movie collection than Itunes'\n    - Cache converted videos\n    - Improve overall stability\n    - Improve torrent picking algorithm (by seeds/leechers, size, votes, video format ...)\n    - Package using NodeWebkit for Windows/Mac/Linux/Raspberry PI\n    - Correct boot on Raspberry Pi\n    - Add other awesome stuff!\n\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThere are obvious legal issues, with downloading copyrighted material you do not have a license for.

Note that you need a seperate folder and must not reuse existing build for upstream Hikari\n\n## Obtaining Source\n- ``git clone https://github.com/HikariObfuscator/Hanabi.git $(LLVM_SOURCE_PATH)/projects/``\n- Under ``$(LLVM_SOURCE_PATH)``, run ``git submodule update --init --recursive --remote`` to make sure submodules are fully updated\n\n## Build\n- ``cmake $(LLVM_SOURCE_PATH) -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ABI_BREAKING_CHECKS=FORCE_OFF -G Ninja``\n- ``ninja LLVMHanabi``\n- Copy ``$(LLVM_BUILD_PATH)/lib/libLLVMHanabiDeps.dylib`` to ``/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/``\n- Copy ``$(LLVM_BUILD_PATH)/lib/libLLVMHanabi.dylib`` to ``/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/``\n- Copy ``$(LLVM_SOURCE_PATH)/projects/Hanabi/libsubstitute.dylib`` to ``/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/``\n\n# Patching\n\nYou need to build ``https://github.com/alexzielenski/optool`` and put it in your $PATH, then you need to patch two libraries into Clang/SwiftC.\n**!!!ORDER IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!**\n- ``sudo optool install -c load -p @executable_path/libLLVMHanabiDeps.dylib -t /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/clang``\n- ``sudo optool install -c load -p @executable_path/libLLVMHanabi.dylib -t /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/clang``\n\n# Known Issues\n- LLVM 6.0.1 (which Xcode 10.1 and before is using) has bugs related to ``indirectbr`` CodeGeneration, you might get a crash if you enable ``INDIBRAN``. Try updating your Xcode version\n\n\n# How it works\n- Strictly speaking, many changes are done to the Hikari Core to reduce LLVM library dependencies.\n- Loader's linking options is modified to link to no LLVM library and fully resolve them at runtime in a flat namespace, this loader is also known as ``libLLVMHanabi.dylib``\n- Then, we ship a custom mimimal subset of LLVM Core Libraries which serves as the fallback plan for symbols that are not exported in Apple's binaries, this is known as ``libLLVMHanabiDeps.dylib``.\n- By not linking the full LLVM suite, we are allowed to reduce build time and more importantly, allows us to pass arguments like we normally would. (``-mllvm``)\n\n\n# Release Versioning Scheme\nThe releases has a versioning scheme like ``6.0@9ab263@LoaderV3`` where the first part represents LLVM base version, the second represents Hikari Core's git commit hash and the third one represents the Loader implementation version. In this case, it means the release is tested to work on a Xcode version that uses LLVM6.0. You can refer to ``Toolchain version history`` in [Xcode - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode) and uses the ``LLVM`` column to find the matching Xcode version, which is this case is ``Xcode 10.0`` and ``Xcode 10.1``. This release uses [Core](https://github.com/HikariObfuscator/Core) at 9ab263 and V3 of the loader\n# Credits\n\n- Thanks to [@AloneMonkey](https://github.com/AloneMonkey) for compiling substitute and ship it with his amazing project [MonkeyDev](https://github.com/AloneMonkey/MonkeyDev/blob/master/MFrameworks/libsubstitute.dylib)\n- Thanks to [@UESTC-LXY](https://github.com/UESTC-LXY) for testing and discussion because I didn't bother to do so.\n- Thanks to[@qokelate](https://github.com/qokelate) for initially discovering the broken CMake script and testing the new fix as well as suggestions to this README\n"

  "readme_contents": "# bad-apple\n Bad Apple printed out on the console with Python!\n\n![Bad apple!!](bad_apple_gif.gif)\n\n# Preface\nA word of disclaimer, while the final code is somewhat original, this project is an amalgamation of different code snippets that I found online. As the main YouTube Video begins to gain traction, I feel the need to inform the audience that this code is NOT ENTIRELY ORIGINAL. \n\nThe concept of playing Bad Apple!! on a Command Line Interface (CLI) is not a novel idea and I am definitely not the first. \n\nThere are many iterations and versions around YouTube and I wanted to give it a shot. The intent of posting the video on YouTube was to show a few friends of a simple weekend project that I whipped up in Python. \n\nMy own video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZfrXrk3ZHc).\n\n# Running this code/Pre-requisites\nThanks to [TheHusyin](https://github.com/TheHusyin) for adding a `requirements.txt` file for easier installs.\n\nYou can either `git clone` or download a ZIP of this repository. \n\n`git clone https://github.com/CalvinLoke/bad-apple`\n\nThen, ensure that you set your terminal to the directory of this repository. \n\n`cd bad-apple`\n\nInstall the necessary dependencies and packages by using:\n\n`pip install -r requirements.txt`\n\nAnd to run the code:\n\n`python touhou_bad_apple_v4.0.py`\n\nAnd just follow the on-screen prompts. \n\n# Performance optimizations\nCurrently, my implementation of a rudimentary static `time.sleep()` function results in an incremental error over time. \nThis thus leads to the frame accuracy drifting. \n\n**UPDATE on 22/04/21** \n\nWith the replacement of the `playsound` library with `pygame`, the error over time seemed to have been fixed. Though, \nfurther improvements and optimizations to the code can still be done. As of current, performance is still not optimal.\nA major bottleneck lies in the IOPS when dealing with the .txt files, am still trying to find a better implementation. \n\nI am also looking into improving frame extraction and generation times.\n\n**UPDATE ON 23/04/21**\n\nIt seems that frame extraction is heavily bottle-necked by the drive's IOPS, and adding threads did not seem to expediate\nframe extraction further. I have created some rudimentary code for process-based and threading-based frame extraction,\nam looking to implement it for the ASCII generation soon. \n\n**UPDATE ON 25/04/21**\n\nI got about to implementing multi-processing for both frame extraction and ASCII generation. Though it seems that my implementation of threading/processing is still very botchy and thus asset generation is still sub-optimal. Not too sure on how far I would want to take this project, though my main priority right now would be to adjust frame timings. \n\n**SECOND UPDATE ON 25/04/21**\n\nSimply by replacing the primitive `time.sleep()` function with the `fpstimer` library, frame-time accuracy has been drastically improved, will be slowing down my code optimizations for playback from now onwards. \n\nThough the main concern right now is trying to optimize asset generation times. \n\n**THIRD UPDATE ON 25/04/21**\n\nChanged the approach of storing assets. Should significantly reduce asset generation times, averaging arond 10 ~ 15 seconds using single thread. Will still look into threading to further expedite asset generation. However, with `touhou_bad_apple_v4.0.py`, progress will now slow down as I finally close the chapter of this project. \n\n**UPDATE ON 27/04/21**\n\nIt looks like most of the issues have been rectified, and the code has reached desirableh performance. While I could further boost ASCII generation and add new functionality to the code, I feel that it would be over-engineering such a simple project. What started out as a weekend project blew up to such proportions, and led me to learn many new and interesting concepts along the way. \n\nI really would like to thank [JasperTecHK](https://github.com/JasperTecHK) for his recommendations and suggestions along the way. His input was what really led me to return to this project after two dead weeks. \n\nAs such, major updates to the code would come much slower now, as the current iteration of the project has far exceeded my orginal goal. Though, it would be interesting to further develop `v4.5` to have color support, but I would presume that requires its own development cycle. Once again, I really would like to thank all the contributors to this simple and dumb piece of code that I wrote in 24 hours. \n\nCheers!\n\n# Current known issues and bugs\nDespite being a somewhat simple program, my crappy implementation has led to a lot of unresovled bugs and issues. I am currently\nlooking at fixing some of them. \n\n1) block=False is not supported in Linux (Only for v2.0 and below)\n\n~~I am currently trying to find alternatives to the `playsound` library. Using two different threads is not an option currently as\nI was running into desynchronization issues~~\n\nThis issue has been fixed in ~~v3~~ v2.5, alongside other performance improvements. \n\n2) No such file or directory: 'ExtractedFrames/BadApple_1.jpg' (Only for v3.0 and v2.5)\n\n~~Not really sure how this is happening, but will be looking into fixing it. I was unable to replicate the error but I assume it is \ndue to my botchy implementation of file directories for the assets~~\n\nIssue could be due to host machine not having ffmpeg installed. Ensure that you have ffmpeg installed and run the script again. v4 and v4.5 will not return this error, though will need to do some limit testing to figure it out. \n\n# Version descriptor\n1) touhou_bad_apple_v1.py\n\nFirst rudimentary version that accomplishes basic frame extraction and animation. Utilizes threads, but suffers from heavy\nsynchronization issues.\n\n2) touhou_bad_apple_v2.py \n\nExtended version that includes a \"GUI\", some basic file I/O. Suffers from slight synchronization issues. Core program \nlogic was completed in 24 hours with some minor tweaks and comments afterwards. \n\n3) ~~touhou_bad_apple_v3.py~~ ==> Renamed to touhou_bad_apple_v2.5.py\n\n~~Current development version. Improved frame time delay and better file I/O. Looking to implement threading to expedite frame extraction and ASCII conversion. Play-testing version to use py-game. Doesn't really warrant a full version increment, will be updating the name to v2.5 or something like that once the new v4 is ready~~\n\nSlightly better version due to incorporation of `pygame` for music playing. Rectifies issue when attempting to play on Linux based environments since the older `playsound` library did not support `blocking=False` on said environments. \n\nStill has rudimentary frame extraction and ASCII generation on single thread/process, which makes asset generation significantly longer.\n\n4) ~~touhou_bad_apple_v4.py~~ ==> Renamed to touhou_bad_apple_v3.0.py\n\n~~(Almost) re-written as the previous code was getting to messy to work with. Functions from previous versions are still used though.~~\n\n~~Will be renamed to v3 once I improve asset generation times with better threading code. However, \"v4\" is currently the most frame-accurate version thanks to the `fpstimer` library. And subsequent changes are only for smaller performance optimizations.~~\n\nRewritten to incorporate multiprocess, though implementation is very janky. Overall program structure was also refactored a bit to clean up `main()` function. Asset generation times were reduced a bit, but the double `for` loop meant that it generation times are close to a minute. \n\n5) ~~touhou_bad_apple_v4-5.py~~ ==> Renamed to touhou_bad_apple_v4.0.py\n\nOnce again my dumb naming schemes kick in again. After some toying around, I decided to scrap the .txt file generation\nand skip right storing ASCII within memory. This version completely rewrites the asset generation algorithm. Instead of the old \n\nVideo => Extracted_Images (stored in storage) => ASCII Characters (stored in memory) => .txt (stored in storage)\n\nprocess, ASCII generation is done on the image stored within memory, so \n\nVideo => Extracted_Images (stored in memory) => ASCII Characters (stored in memory) => Internal list (stored in memory)\n\nMakes more sense as compared to older iterations and significantly cuts down asset generation times. \n\nWhile this means that 10 or 20 seconds is required for ASCII generation,\nit eliminates storage IO bottleneck. Also frees up a lot of storage space on host system. Overall probably the best one yet? \n\n\n6) ~~touhou_bad_apple_v5.py~~ ==> Renamed to touhou_bad_apple_v4.5.py\n\nHonestly I should not even get a job at file versioning. This version essentially allows the user to ASCII-fy any video\nprovided that they have the video file in the root directory. \n \n\n\n# Functions\nThe main functions will be listed here. \n\n## play_video()\nReads the files from the previously generated ASCII .txt files and prints it out onto the console. \n\n## play_audio()\nPlays the bad apple audio track. \n\n## progress_bar(current, total, barLength=25)\nA simple progress bar function that generates the status of both frame extraction and ASCII frame generation. \nThis code was taken from a [StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6169217/replace-console-output-in-python).\n\n`current` is the current value/progress of the process. \n\n`total` is the desired/intended end value of the process.\n\n`barLength=25` sets the length of the progress bar. (Default is 25 characters)\n\n## ASCII Frame generation\nNot a particular function, but a group of functions.\n\n```\nresize_image()\n\ngreyscale()\n\npixels_to_ascii()\n```\nThese functions are called in the `ascii_generator()` function to convert image files to ASCII format and stores them into .txt files. \n\nNote that the ASCII conversion code is not original, and was taken from \n[here](https://github.com/kiteco/python-youtube-code/blob/master/ascii/ascii_convert.py).\n\n# Words of acknowledgements\nI should give credit where credit is due, and here is a section dedicated to that. \n\nZUN, and this incredible work on the Touhou project over the past decades.\n\n[Alstroemeria Records](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ2uGVzfIbcqvZvrS0BVucw), \nfor making the original [Bad Apple!!

[Ejecta](https://github.com/phoboslab/Ejecta) has switched to the JSC library provided by the System. It still has some limitations (no native Typed Array API) as of 2016.03.30, but they are mostly workaroundable. \n\nAlso, compiling it for tvOS requires bitcode compilation now, which this fork of JSC does not support. You can read up on the [fascinating details in my blog](http://phoboslab.org/log/2015/11/the-absolute-worst-way-to-read-typed-array-data-with-javascriptcore).\n\n# JavaScriptCore iOS\n\nThe JavaScriptCore library is part of the [WebKit project](http://www.webkit.org/) and thus Open Source. However, in the sources you get from the [WebKit SVN](https://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/trunk), the XCode project files are curiously missing an iOS compile target. The sources you get from [opensource.apple.com](http://opensource.apple.com/release/ios-601/) are missing the project files altogether. You can't compile it at all. That's quite the Open Source spirit, Apple!\n\nThis repo aims to re-produce the missing iOS targets while staying on a somewhat up-to-date version.\n\nCurrently, the [Safari-538.11.1 tag](https://svn.webkit.org/repository/webkit/tags/Safari-538.11.1/) is used as the basis. With the current settings, the WTF and JavaScriptCore libraries can be compiled for armv7, armv7s, arm64 and x86 (for the iOS simulator). It will be compiled without Unicode collation support, because Apple claims [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org/) is a private framework on iOS. It should be AppStore compatible this way.\n\nThis version of JSC deprecates the `typed-arrays` branch of this repository. JSC now supports Typed Arrays natively, without any hacks.\n\nNote however, that the source code of JSC was still modified:\n\n- It includes some API methods to work with Typed Arrays in native code. Have a look at the `API/JSTypedArray.h`, it declares three new API functions. The documentation for these functions can be found in this header file as well.\n- `Number.MIN_VALUE` was fixed to return `DBL_MIN` instead of `0` when the CPU has not enabled support denormal numbers.\n\n## Binaries\n\nA compiled version of the `libJavaScriptCore.a` for armv7, armv7s, arm64 and the Simulator can be found in the [source tree](https://github.com/phoboslab/Ejecta/tree/master/Source/lib) of the [Ejecta project](https://github.com/phoboslab/Ejecta).\n\n## How to Compile\n\n1. Run `python make.py`.\n2. Get coffee! Building this takes a while ;P\n\nYou can do `python make.py --help` for more options.\n"

Sometimes, you just want to pop a message that tells the user that something completed, or his message was sent. Apple doesn't provide any other method rather than using `Alert` even though Apple using all kinds of different pop-ups. The results are poor UX where the user would need to tap \"OK/Dismiss\" for every little information that he should be notified about.\n\nAlert Toast is an open-source library in Github to use with SwiftUI. It allows you to present popups that don't need any user action to dismiss or to validate. Some great usage examples: `Message Sent`, `Poor Network Connection`, `Profile Updated`, `Logged In/Out`, `Favorited`, `Loading` and so on...\n\n<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/BUILD-1.3.7-green?style=for-the-badge\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/PLATFORM-IOS%20|%20MACOS-lightgray?style=for-the-badge\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/LICENSE-MIT-lightgray?style=for-the-badge\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/MADE WITH-SWIFTUI-orange?style=for-the-badge\" />\n\n* Built with pure SwiftUI.\n* 3 Display modes: `Alert` (pop at the center), `HUD` (drop from the top) and `Banner` (pop/slide from the bottom).\n* `Complete`, `Error` `SystemImage`, `Image`, `Loading`, and `Regular` (Only Text).\n* Supports Light & Dark Mode.\n* Works with **any** kind of view builder.\n* Localization support.\n* Font & Background customization.\n\n#### If you like the project, don't forget to `put star \ud83c\udf1f`.\n\n<a href=\"mailto:elai950@gmail.com\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/EMAIL-ELAI-informational?style=for-the-badge&logo=minutemailer&logoColor=white\"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elai-zuberman-8120a073/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/LINKEDIN-informational?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white\" ></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=5JN5PT55NAHKU\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-informational?style=for-the-badge&logo=paypal&logoColor=white\" ></a>\n\n## Navigation\n\n- [Installation](#-installation)\n    - [CocoaPods](#cocoapods)\n    - [Swift Package Manager](#swift-package-manager)\n    - [Manually](#manually)\n- [Usage](#-usage)\n    - [Usage example with regular alert](#usage-example-with-regular-alert)\n    - [Complete Modifier Example](#complete-modifier-example)\n    - [Alert Toast Parameters](#alert-toast-parameters)\n - [Article](#-article)\n - [Contributing](#-contributing)\n - [Author](#-author)\n - [License](#-license)\n\n## \ud83d\udcbb Installation\n\n### Cocoapods\n\n[AlertToast Cocapods Website](https://cocoapods.org/pods/AlertToast)\n\nCocoaPods is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate `AlertToast` into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:\n\n```ruby\npod 'AlertToast'\n```\n\n------\n\n### Swift Package Manager\n\nThe [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. It\u2019s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.\n\nTo integrate `AlertToast` into your Xcode project using Xcode 12, specify it in `File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...`:\n\n```ogdl\nhttps://github.com/elai950/AlertToast.git, :branch=\"master\"\n```\n\nFor Xcode 13, please refer [this article](https://iiroalhonen.medium.com/adding-a-swift-package-dependency-in-xcode-13-937b2caaf218) to install `AlertToast` \n\n------\n\n### Manually\n\nIf you prefer not to use any of dependency managers, you can integrate `AlertToast` into your project manually. Put `Sources/AlertToast` folder in your Xcode project. Make sure to enable `Copy items if needed` and `Create groups`.\n\n## \ud83e\uddf3 Requirements\n\n- iOS 13.0+ | macOS 11+\n- Xcode 12.0+ | Swift 5+\n\n## \ud83d\udee0 Usage\n\nFirst, add `import AlertToast` on every `swift` file you would like to use `AlertToast`.\n\nThen, use the `.toast` view modifier:\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `isPresenting`: (MUST) assign a `Binding<Bool>` to show or dismiss alert.\n- `duration`: default is 2, set 0 to disable auto dismiss.\n- `tapToDismiss`: default is `true`, set `false` to disable.\n- `alert`: (MUST) expects `AlertToast`.\n\n#### Usage example with regular alert\n\n```swift \nimport AlertToast\nimport SwiftUI\n\nstruct ContentView: View{\n\n    @State private var showToast = false\n\n    var body: some View{\n        VStack{\n\n            Button(\"Show Toast\"){\n                 showToast.toggle()\n            }\n        }\n        .toast(isPresenting: $showToast){\n\n            // `.alert` is the default displayMode\n            AlertToast(type: .regular, title: \"Message Sent!\")\n            \n            //Choose .hud to toast alert from the top of the screen\n            //AlertToast(displayMode: .hud, type: .regular, title: \"Message Sent!\")\n            \n            //Choose .banner to slide/pop alert from the bottom of the screen\n            //AlertToast(displayMode: .banner(.slide), type: .regular, title: \"Message Sent!\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Complete Modifier Example\n\n```swift\n.toast(isPresenting: $showAlert, duration: 2, tapToDismiss: true, alert: {\n   //AlertToast goes here\n}, onTap: {\n   //onTap would call either if `tapToDismis` is true/false\n   //If tapToDismiss is true, onTap would call and then dismis the alert\n}, completion: {\n   //Completion block after dismiss\n})\n```\n\n### Alert Toast Parameters\n\n```swift\nAlertToast(displayMode: DisplayMode,\n           type: AlertType,\n           title: Optional(String),\n           subTitle: Optional(String),\n           style: Optional(AlertStyle))\n           \n//This is the available customizations parameters:\nAlertStyle(backgroundColor: Color?,\n            titleColor: Color?,\n            subTitleColor: Color?,\n            titleFont: Font?,\n            subTitleFont: Font?)\n```\n\n#### Available Alert Types:\n- **Regular:** text only (Title and Subtitle).\n- **Complete:** animated checkmark.\n- **Error:** animated xmark.\n- **System Image:** name image from `SFSymbols`.\n- **Image:** name image from Assets.\n- **Loading:** Activity Indicator (Spinner).\n\n#### Alert dialog view modifier (with default settings):\n```swift\n.toast(isPresenting: Binding<Bool>, duration: Double = 2, tapToDismiss: true, alert: () -> AlertToast , onTap: () -> (), completion: () -> () )\n```\n\n#### Simple Text Alert:\n```swift\nAlertToast(type: .regular, title: Optional(String), subTitle: Optional(String))\n```\n\n#### Complete/Error Alert:\n```swift\nAlertToast(type: .complete(Color)/.error(Color), title: Optional(String), subTitle: Optional(String))\n```\n\n#### System Image Alert:\n```swift\nAlertToast(type: .systemImage(String, Color), title: Optional(String), subTitle: Optional(String))\n```\n\n#### Image Alert:\n```swift\nAlertToast(type: .image(String), title: Optional(String), subTitle: Optional(String))\n```\n\n#### Loading Alert:\n```swift\n//When using loading, duration won't auto dismiss and tapToDismiss is set to false\nAlertToast(type: .loading, title: Optional(String), subTitle: Optional(String))\n```\n\nYou can add many `.toast` on a single view.\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 Article\n\nI wrote an article that contains more usage examples.\n\n[Medium - How to toast an alert in SwiftUI](https://elaizuberman.medium.com/presenting-apples-music-alerts-in-swiftui-7f5c32cebed6)\n\n## \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Contributors\n\nAll issue reports, feature requests, pull requests and GitHub stars are welcomed and much appreciated.\n\n- [@barnard-b](https://github.com/barnard-b)\n\n## \u270d\ufe0f Author\n\nElai Zuberman\n\n## \ud83d\udcc3 License\n\n`AlertToast` is available under the MIT license.

As such, the license for this project does not apply to assets in this repository owned by the aforementioned companies._\n\n## What devices can I run this on?\n\nThe only real limitation is screen size. Any full-screen Apple Watch should work (4 or above), though I haven't tested it on the Series 3. Feel free to give it a shot and report back how it goes! I'd imagine that simple apps like the digital watch should fit but more complex apps like the calculator will have elements cut off.\n\n## How do I put this on my Apple Watch?\n\nBy sideloading! This is a pretty complicated and involved process that will probably only make sense if you're a developer, but [here's](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/running-your-app-in-the-simulator-or-on-a-device) Apple's documentation on running custom apps on your devices using Xcode.\n\n## Will this be posted to the App Store?\n\nNope, this is a fan project of some fantastic games and I am in no position to publish this to the App Store as my own creation. Hopefully this will inspire an official Poketch app to be developed for smart watches at some point!\n\n## What apps does it have?\n\nAll kinds!\n\n![](/Resources/device-screenshots/simulator-screenshot-digital-watch.png)\n\n![](/Resources/device-screenshots/simulator-screenshot-calculator.png)\n\n![](/Resources/device-screenshots/simulator-screenshot-pedometer.png)\n\n![](/Resources/device-screenshots/simulator-screenshot-dowsing-machine.png)\n\n![](/Resources/device-screenshots/simulator-screenshot-counter.png)\n\n![](/Resources/device-screenshots/simulator-screenshot-analog-watch.png)\n\n![](/Resources/device-screenshots/simulator-screenshot-marking-map.png)\n\n![](/Resources/device-screenshots/simulator-screenshot-coin-toss.png)\n\n![](/Resources/device-screenshots/simulator-screenshot-move-tester.png)\n\n![](/Resources/device-screenshots/simulator-screenshot-color-changer-green.png)\n\n![](/Resources/device-screenshots/simulator-screenshot-color-changer-stopwatch.png)\n\nI added the apps that seemed to make the most sense on an Apple Watch, as well as some of my favorites that gave the original Poketch its charm.

It's the easiest to go to your Project Settings -> Swift Packages and add MKRingProgressView from there._\n\nTo integrate using Apple's Swift package manager, without Xcode integration, add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:\n\n```swift\n.package(url: \"https://github.com/maxkonovalov/MKRingProgressView.git\", .upToNextMajor(from: \"2.3.0\"))\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nSee the example Xcode project. It contains 2 targets:\n- **ProgressRingExample** - a simple example containing a single progress ring with adjustable parameters.\n- **ActivityRingsExample** - an advanced usage example replicating Activity app by Apple. It also contains additional classes for convenient grouping of 3 ring progress views together.\n\n### Interface Builder\n\n`MKRingProgressView` can be set up in Interface Builder. To use it, set the custom view class to `MKRingProgressView`. Most of the control's parameters can be customized in Interface Builder.\n\n### Code\n\n```swift\nlet ringProgressView = RingProgressView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 100, width: 100, height: 100))\nringProgressView.startColor = .red\nringProgressView.endColor = .magenta\nringProgressView.ringWidth = 25\nringProgressView.progress = 0.0\nview.addSubview(ringProgressView)\n```\n\nThe `progress` value can be animated the same way you would normally animate any property using `UIView`'s block-based animations: \n\n```swift\nUIView.animate(withDuration: 0.5) {\n    ringProgressView.progress = 1.0\n}\n```\n\n## Performance\n\nTo achieve better performance the following options are possible:\n\n- Set `gradientImageScale` to lower values like `0.5` (defaults to `1.0`)\n- Set `startColor` and `endColor` to the same value\n- Set `shadowOpacity` to `0.0`\n- Set `allowsAntialiasing` to `false`\n\n## Requirements\n\n- iOS 9.0\n- tvOS 9.0\n\n## License\n\n`MKRingProgressView` is available under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more info.\n"

  "readme_contents": "This is cdecl, the C gibberish translator. This version has been enhanced\nby ridiculous_fish to support Apple's blocks syntax.\n\nVisit https://cdecl.org to use it online.\n\nOriginal README follows:\n\n\t\t\tCdecl version 2.5\n\nCdecl is a program which will turn English-like phrases such as \"declare\nfoo as array 5 of pointer to function returning int\" into C declarations\nsuch as \"int (*foo[5])()\".  It can also translate the C into the pseudo-\nEnglish.  And it handles typecasts, too.  Plus C++.  And in this version\nit has command line editing and history with the GNU readline library.\n\nThe files in this distribution are:\n\ncdecl.c\t\tThe cdecl source code.\ncdlex.l\t\tThe lex source for the cdecl lexer.\ncdgram.y\tThe yacc source for the cdecl parser.\ncdecl.1\t\tThe cdecl man page.\nc++decl.1\tThe c++decl man page (really just cdecl.1).\ntestset\t\tA script to test the operation of cdecl.\ntestset++\tA script to test the operation of c++decl.\nMakefile\tThe makefile to build and install cdecl.\nREADME\t\tSee file README for description of this file.\n\nIf you have the GNU readline library and its headers in readline/*.h and\ntermcap then you can install cdecl by \"make\" followed by \"make install\".\nTo compile without readline and termcap, you must edit the Makefile and\nremove -DUSE_READLINE from the CFLAGS and -lreadline and -ltermcap from\nthe LIBS.  You will, unfortunately, lose the command line editing,\nhistory, and keyword completion.  By default cdecl installs in /usr/bin,\nbut this is configurable in the Makefile.\n\nI debated with myself whether to provide a precompiled libreadline.a and\nassociated headers with the cdecl distribution, however that would have\nmade the tar file *much* bigger, so I have decided not to.  If you think\nI should, or you would like me to send you readline, please get in touch\nwith me at conrad@detroit.freenet.org.  You can find the source for\nreadline in the bash distribution on prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu or on\nftp.uu.net:/pub/gnu, or wherever fine GNU source isn't sold.\n\nYou should also be able to find a ready-to-run ELF binary of cdecl in the\nsame place you got this from.  It should be on sunsite.unc.edu in the\ndirectory /pub/Linux/devel/lang/c/, or on any of the many sunsite mirrors.\nMy three favorites are ftp.cc.gatech.edu, ftp.cdrom.com, and\nuiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu.\n\nYou may well be wondering what the status of cdecl is.  So am I.  It was\ntwice posted to comp.sources.unix, but neither edition carried any mention\nof copyright.  This version is derived from the second edition.  I have\nno reason to believe there are any limitations on its use, and strongly\nbelieve it to be in the Public Domain.  GNU readline is, of course,\ncovered by the GNU General Public License.\n\nI was inspired to port cdecl to Linux as there was no version of it\navailable in the various Linux software archives that I am aware of.\nThe addition of GNU readline support seemed like a logical extension\nof the program.  Be warned, however, that linking with readline more\nthan doubles the size of the program.  Those whose main concern is\nspace might wish to build a version without readline.\n\nDavid R.

  "language": "C",
  "readme_contents": "apple2pi\n========\n\nWhat is the Apple II Pi?\n------------------------\nBasically, the Apple II Pi is the integration of an Apple II with a Raspberry Pi (http://www.raspberrypi.org) to create a hybrid computer combining the input devices and storage mediums of the Apple with the CPU, GPU (graphical processing unit), USB, and network capabilities of the Broadcom BCM2835 SoC (think smartphone processor).  The concept is to create an updated version of the Apple II using some imagination, low-level drivers, off-the-shelf hardware, and a closely coupled communications channel; thus bringing semi-modern hardware and 32 bit *nix software to the Apple II platform.  The Apple II is running as a dedicated I/O processor for the Raspberry Pi under ProDOS.  The Raspberry Pi is running a version of Debian Linux: Raspbian.  Much like the PC Transporter card brought MS-DOS and the Z-80 card brought CP/M, the Apple II Pi brings Linux to the Apple II using the Apple\u2019s input devices and the Raspberry Pi\u2019s video output.  As such, knowledge and familiarity with Linux is required to get the most out of its environment.  Under Linux, the Apple II Pi can read and write the Apple\u2019s storage devices (floppies/harddrives/CFFA) and also run the GSport Apple IIgs emulator (http://gsport.sourceforge.net).  Together, GSport and Apple II Pi provide an immersive environment providing access to most of the Apple II hardware you own plus an accelerated ~20MHz 65816 with up to 8 MB RAM, and all the disk images you can fit on the SD card.\n\nApple II client/server for Raspberry Pi\n---------------------------------------\n\nApple II Pi works by connecting an Apple II to a Raspberry Pi using a RS232 serial connection.  In order to get the Raspberry Pi to talk RS232 from it's 3.3V GPIO serial port, you will need to build or buy a converter.  They are very cheap on eBay, so I would recommend going that route. Alternatively, you can use a USB serial port converter, but you will need to know its tty device name. To ensure you've hooked the converter up correctly, try loggin into the Raspberry Pi from another modern-ish computer.  Raspbian, the default Debian based Linux for the Raspberry Pi, opens up a login (getty) session on the serial port at 115.2K baud.  You will probably need a null modem or cross-over cable to login from another computer.  Once it all checks out, time to connect your Apple II.  All the 3.3V converters and USB serial ports I see have a DB-9 connector and many of the Apple II era connectors are DB-25 so you may need a DB-9 to DB-25 converter.\n\nInstalling and configuring the Apple II:  You will need an Apple //c or Apple ][, //e, IIgs w/ SuperSerial Card.  An Apple ][ requires the SHIFT key mod.  An Apple II Mouse is recommended for that full-on retro feel, but not required.  Download and install the A2PI.PO disk image onto a 5 1/4 floppy.  ADTPro would be the recommended tool for that operation although once you have the latest apple2pi version running, you can use the included dskwrite and dskread utilities for writing and reading ProDOS floppies.\n\nInstalling and configuring the Raspberry Pi:  Download the apple2pi project to your Raspberry Pi.  Enter the apple2pi/src directory.  Compile the daemon and tools with 'make' and copy the results to /usr/local/bin with 'sudo make install'.  To build the FUSE driver needed to mount ProDOS devices under Linux, you will need the libfuse-dev package installed.  Get this from apt-get, aptitude, or whichever package manager you like.  Build with 'make fusea2pi' and install with 'sudo make fuse-install'.\n\nThe following is no longer neessary as the install script carefully makes all the following adjustments automatically.  I left this here so you know what the script is doing.\n\n\n>You will need to disable the Raspbain serial login by editing /etc/inittab and commenting out the line (probably at the very bottom) to look like:<br>\n<code>\n\\#T0:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyAMA0 115200 vt100\n</code>\n<br>\nYou will also want to disable the console messages that go out to the serial port in the /boot/cmdline.txt file.  Remove the \"console=\" clause and the \"kgdboc=\" clause from the /boot/cmdline.txt file.  Mine looks like:<br>\n<code>\ndwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait\n</code>\n\n>If you are using an HDMI port to display video, skip the overscan settings.  This was for my monitor and your values may vary (a lot). I adjust the NTSC output so it fits nicely on my //c monitor, I edited the setting in /boot/config.txt such that:\n\n><code>\noverscan_left=26<br>\noverscan_right=-8<br>\noverscan_top=-8<br>\n\\#overscan_bottom=16<br>\n</code>\n\n>To run the a2pid daemon automatically at boot time, edit /etc/rc.local and add:\n\n><code>\n/usr/local/bin/a2pid --daemon\n</code>\n\n>right before the line:\n\n><code>\nexit 0\n</code>\n\nfollowed by rebooting the Raspberry Pi.\n\nNOTE - For USB serial port users and non-Raspberry Pi owners:  This isn't actually tied to the Raspberry Pi in any way, except for the default serial port used to connect the Pi to the Apple II.  On most up-to-date Linux distributions, you should be able to build all the files.  To run the daemon on a specific serial port, just add it as a command line option i.e. a2pid --daemon /dev/ttyUSB0\n\nReboot the Apple II with the newly created floppy in the start-up drive.  If everything is configured correctly, you should be able to login to the Raspberry Pi with your Apple II keyboard.  If you have an Apple II Mouse, that should control the cursor in X, or in the console if you have gdm installed.\n\nUsing a2pi: The Apple //c and //e keyboards are pretty minimal compared to modern keyboards, and the Apple II Mouse only has one button.  In order to provide most of the funcitonality required of modern OSes, the Open-Apple and Closed-Apple keys are used as modifiers to enhance the keyboard and mouse.  On the keyboard, Open-Apple acts just like the Alt key.  The Closed-Apple key acts like a Fn key, changing the actual key codes.  Currently, the Closed-Apple key will modify the number keys 1-0 as funciton keys F1-F10 and the arrow keys as Left-Arrow=Home, Right-Arrow=End, Up-Arrow=PgUp, Down-Arrow=PgDn.  For the mouse, when you click the mouse button by itself, that is the left(default)-click.  Open-Apple along with the mouse button will return the right-click, and Closed-Apple along with the mouse button will return the middle-click.  a2pid can be run directly (not as a daemon) by leaving off the '--daemon' option.  Enabling printf's in the code allows one to watch the packets arrive and get processed when run from a network ssh session.\n\nTheory of operation:  Apple II Pi works by running code on the Apple II and the Raspberry Pi, talking to each other with a simple protocol.  The Apple II basically appears to the Raspberry Pi as an external peripheral, not unlike a USB keyboard and mouse.  The Apple II floppy boots into ProDOS and runs a simple machine language program that scans the keyboard, and mouse if present, sending the events out the serial port to the Raspberry Pi.  It is a very simple protocol and the serial port is running at 115.2K baud, so it is fast and low overhead.  On the Raspberry Pi, a little daemon runs, waiting for packets on the serial port, converts the Apple II events into Linux compatible events, and inserts them into the input subsystem.  This daemon also has a socket interface (port 6551) that can be used to access the Apple II memory and execute arbitrary code.  Look at a2lib.c for implementation.\n\nEnjoy,\n\nDave Schmenk\n"

Iterate over nested, or multidimensional, hashes.\n\n\n## The Holiday Suppliers\n\n### Instructions\n\nYou have a bunch of decorations for various holidays organized by season.\n\n```ruby\nholiday_supplies = {\n  :winter => {\n    :christmas => [\"Lights\", \"Wreath\"],\n    :new_years => [\"Party Hats\"]\n  },\n  :summer => {\n    :fourth_of_july => [\"Fireworks\", \"BBQ\"]\n  },\n  :fall => {\n    :thanksgiving => [\"Turkey\"]\n  },\n  :spring => {\n    :memorial_day => [\"BBQ\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWrite your methods in `lib/holiday.rb`; use the comments in each method as guides.\n\n* Write a method that returns the second supply for the Fourth of July. For eg:\n\n```ruby\ndef second_supply_for_fourth_of_july(holiday_supplies)\n  holiday_supplies[:summer][:fourth_of_july][1]\nend\n```\n\n* Write a method that adds a supply to both Winter holidays.\n\n* Write a method that adds a supply to Memorial Day.\n\n* Write a method that adds a new holiday and its associated supplies to any season.\n\n* Write a method to collect all Winter supplies from all the winter holidays. For eg:\n\n```bash\nwinter_supplies(holiday_supplies) #=> [\"Lights\", \"Wreath\", etc]\n```\n\n* Write a method that uses a loop to list out all the supplies you have for each holiday and the season. Use string manipulation to get your output to match what the test is expecting.\n\n* Here are a few helpful tips:\n  * Our hash keys are symbols. We need to convert them into strings. Use the `.to_s` method on a symbol to convert it into a string.\n  * Look closely at the output string that the test is expecting. You'll notice that it expects holiday names, like \"New Years\", to have both words capitalized. Ruby has a `.capitalize` method that you can call on a string. **But, note:**\n    * `.capitalize` returns the capitalized string but *doesn't change* the original string. So, when you call on that same string in the future, it *isn't capitalized!* You can capitalize a string for now and evermore by using the bang operator (`!`).\n    * You'll need to capitalize *both words* in a given holiday's name. If you call `\"new years\".capitalize!`, it will return `\"New years\"`. In order to capitalize *both* words, you'll need to `.split` the string into an array and iterate over that array to `.capitalize!` each word in it. Then, you'll need to `.join` the array back into a string.\n    * If you're unfamiliar with the methods mentioned above, look them up in the Ruby documentation.\n\nExample of expected output:\n\n```\nWinter:\n  Christmas: Lights, Wreath\n  New Years: Party Hats\n```\n\n* Write a method to collect all holidays with \"BBQ\" in the supply array. The method should behave as seen below:\n\n```bash\nholidays_with_bbqs(holiday_supplies)\n#=> [:fourth_of_july, :memorial_day]\n```\n\n**Reminder:** This is a challenging lab, so remember to use Pry, Google, and the Flatiron School community to help you get the tests passing.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [StackOverflow: Accessing Elements of Nested Hashes in Ruby](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5544858/accessing-elements-of-nested-hashes-in-ruby)\n- [honeybadger - Advanced Ruby Hash Techniques](http://blog.honeybadger.io/advanced-ruby-hash-techniques/)\n\n\n<p data-visibility='hidden'>View <a href='https://learn.co/lessons/apples-and-holidays' title='Iterating Over Hashes'>Iterating Over Hashes</a> on Learn.co and start learning to code for free.</p>\n"

You can find them as separate files in the project folder as well as in the `ContentViews` group in Xcode.\n\n## Communication _(Hat Tip AlamoFire)_\n\n- If you **need help**, use [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pkhud). (Tag 'pkhud')\n- If you'd like to **ask a general question**, use [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pkhud).\n- If you **found a bug**, open an issue.\n- If you **have a feature request**, open an issue.\n- If you **want to contribute**, submit a pull request.\n\n\n## Customization\n\nThere are two properties at your disposal to customize general behavior.\n\n- `PKHUD.sharedHUD.dimsBackground: Bool` defines whether the background is slightly dimmed when the HUD is shown.\n\n- `PKHUD.sharedHUD.userInteractionOnUnderlyingViewsEnabled: Bool` defines whether the underlying views respond to touches while the HUD is shown.\n\nAdditionally you are free to create you own custom content views. They can descend from any `UIView` type or the predefined base classes `PKHUDSquareBaseView` and `PKHUDWideBaseView`.\n\n**Note**: It's neither possible to customize the general look and feel, nor do I plan to add that feature. You are free to provide any content views you wish but the blurring, corner radius and shading will remain the same.\n\n## Credits\n\nPKHUD is owned and maintained by Philip Kluz.

The key differentiator is the use of the user's default browser for the\nauthorization, which is more secure, more usable (the user's session can be\nreused) and follows modern OAuth [best practices for native apps](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8252).\nCompatibility methods for GTMOAuth2 are offered allowing you to migrate\nfrom GTMOAuth2 to GTMAppAuth preserving previously serialized authorizations\n(so users shouldn't need to re-authenticate).\n\n## Setup\n\nIf you use [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html),\nsimply add:\n\n    pod 'GTMAppAuth'\n\nTo your `Podfile` and run `pod install`.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Configuration\n\nTo configure GTMAppAuth with the OAuth endpoints for Google, you can use the\nconvenience method:\n\n```objc\nOIDServiceConfiguration *configuration =\n    [GTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization configurationForGoogle];\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can configure GTMAppAuth by specifying the endpoints\ndirectly:\n\n```objc\nNSURL *authorizationEndpoint =\n    [NSURL URLWithString:@\"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth\"];\nNSURL *tokenEndpoint =\n    [NSURL URLWithString:@\"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token\"];\n\nOIDServiceConfiguration *configuration =\n    [[OIDServiceConfiguration alloc]\n        initWithAuthorizationEndpoint:authorizationEndpoint\n                        tokenEndpoint:tokenEndpoint];\n\n// perform the auth request...\n```\n\nOr through discovery:\n\n```objc\nNSURL *issuer = [NSURL URLWithString:@\"https://accounts.google.com\"];\n\n[OIDAuthorizationService discoverServiceConfigurationForIssuer:issuer\n    completion:^(OIDServiceConfiguration *_Nullable configuration,\n                 NSError *_Nullable error) {\n  if (!configuration) {\n    NSLog(@\"Error retrieving discovery document: %@\",\n          [error localizedDescription]);\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // perform the auth request...\n}];\n```\n\n### Authorizing\n\nFirst, you need to have a way for your UIApplicationDelegate to continue the\nauthorization flow session from the incoming redirect URI. Typically you could\nstore the in-progress OIDAuthorizationFlowSession instance in a property:\n\n```objc\n// property of the app's UIApplicationDelegate\n@property(nonatomic, nullable)\n    id<OIDExternalUserAgentSession> currentAuthorizationFlow;\n```\n\nAnd in a location accessible by all controllers that need authorization, a\nproperty to store the authorization state:\n\n```objc\n// property of the containing class\n@property(nonatomic, nullable) GTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization *authorization;\n```\n\nThen, initiate the authorization request. By using the\n`authStateByPresentingAuthorizationRequest` method, the OAuth token\nexchange will be performed automatically, and everything will be protected with\nPKCE (if the server supports it).\n\n```objc\n// builds authentication request\nOIDAuthorizationRequest *request =\n    [[OIDAuthorizationRequest alloc] initWithConfiguration:configuration\n                                                  clientId:kClientID\n                                              clientSecret:kClientSecret\n                                                    scopes:@[OIDScopeOpenID, OIDScopeProfile]\n                                               redirectURL:redirectURI\n                                              responseType:OIDResponseTypeCode\n                                      additionalParameters:nil];\n// performs authentication request\nself.appDelegate.currentAuthorizationFlow =\n    [OIDAuthState authStateByPresentingAuthorizationRequest:request\n        callback:^(OIDAuthState *_Nullable authState,\n                   NSError *_Nullable error) {\n  if (authState) {\n    // Creates the GTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization from the OIDAuthState.\n    GTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization *authorization =\n        [[GTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization alloc] initWithAuthState:authState];\n\n    self.authorization = authorization;\n    NSLog(@\"Got authorization tokens. Access token: %@\",\n          authState.lastTokenResponse.accessToken);\n  } else {\n    NSLog(@\"Authorization error: %@\", [error localizedDescription]);\n    self.authorization = nil;\n  }\n}];\n```\n\n### Handling the Redirect\n\nThe authorization response URL is returned to the app via the platform-specific\napplication delegate method, so you need to pipe this through to the current\nauthorization session (created in the previous session).\n\n#### macOS Custom URI Scheme Redirect Example\n\n```objc\n- (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(NSNotification *)aNotification {\n  // Other app initialization code ...\n\n  // Register for GetURL events.\n  NSAppleEventManager *appleEventManager =\n      [NSAppleEventManager sharedAppleEventManager];\n  [appleEventManager setEventHandler:self\n                         andSelector:@selector(handleGetURLEvent:withReplyEvent:)\n                       forEventClass:kInternetEventClass\n                          andEventID:kAEGetURL];\n}\n\n- (void)handleGetURLEvent:(NSAppleEventDescriptor *)event\n           withReplyEvent:(NSAppleEventDescriptor *)replyEvent {\n  NSString *URLString = [[event paramDescriptorForKeyword:keyDirectObject] stringValue];\n  NSURL *URL = [NSURL URLWithString:URLString];\n  [_currentAuthorizationFlow resumeExternalUserAgentFlowWithURL:URL];\n}\n```\n\n#### iOS Custom URI Scheme Redirect Example\n\n```objc\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app\n            openURL:(NSURL *)url\n            options:(NSDictionary<NSString *, id> *)options {\n  // Sends the URL to the current authorization flow (if any) which will\n  // process it if it relates to an authorization response.\n  if ([_currentAuthorizationFlow resumeExternalUserAgentFlowWithURL:url]) {\n    _currentAuthorizationFlow = nil;\n    return YES;\n  }\n\n  // Your additional URL handling (if any) goes here.\n\n  return NO;\n}\n```\n\n### Making API Calls\n\nThe goal of GTMAppAuth is to enable you to authorize HTTP requests with fresh\ntokens following the Session Fetcher pattern, which you can do like so:\n\n```objc\n// Creates a GTMSessionFetcherService with the authorization.\n// Normally you would save this service object and re-use it for all REST API calls.\nGTMSessionFetcherService *fetcherService = [[GTMSessionFetcherService alloc] init];\nfetcherService.authorizer = self.authorization;\n\n// Creates a fetcher for the API call.\nNSURL *userinfoEndpoint = [NSURL URLWithString:@\"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/userinfo\"];\nGTMSessionFetcher *fetcher = [fetcherService fetcherWithURL:userinfoEndpoint];\n[fetcher beginFetchWithCompletionHandler:^(NSData *data, NSError *error) {\n  // Checks for an error.\n  if (error) {\n    // OIDOAuthTokenErrorDomain indicates an issue with the authorization.\n    if ([error.domain isEqual:OIDOAuthTokenErrorDomain]) {\n      self.authorization = nil;\n      NSLog(@\"Authorization error during token refresh, clearing state. %@\",\n            error);\n    // Other errors are assumed transient.\n    } else {\n      NSLog(@\"Transient error during token refresh. %@\", error);\n    }\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // Parses the JSON response.\n  NSError *jsonError = nil;\n  id jsonDictionaryOrArray =\n      [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:data options:0 error:&jsonError];\n\n  // JSON error.\n  if (jsonError) {\n    NSLog(@\"JSON decoding error %@\", jsonError);\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // Success response!\n  NSLog(@\"Success: %@\", jsonDictionaryOrArray);\n}];\n```\n\n### Saving to the Keychain\n\nYou can easily save `GTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization` instances to the Keychain using\nthe included `GTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization+Keychain` category.\n\n```objc\n// Save to Keychain\n[GTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization saveAuthorization:_authorization\n                                toKeychainForName:kGTMAppAuthExampleAuthorizerKey];\n\n// Restore from Keychain\nGTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization* authorization =\n    [GTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization authorizationFromKeychainForName:kGTMAppAuthExampleAuthorizerKey];\n\n// Remove from Keychain\n[GTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization\n    removeAuthorizationFromKeychainForName:kGTMAppAuthExampleAuthorizerKey];\n```\n\n#### Keychain Storage\n\n`GTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization` instances are stored using Keychain items of the\n[`kSecClassGenericPassword`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/ksecclassgenericpassword?language=objc)\nclass with a [`kSecAttrAccount`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/ksecattraccount?language=objc)\nvalue of \"OAuth\" and a developer supplied value for [`kSecAttrService`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/ksecattrservice?language=objc).\nFor this use of generic password items, the combination of account and service\nvalues acts as the\n[primary key](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/1542001-security_framework_result_codes/errsecduplicateitem?language=objc)\nof the Keychain items.  The\n[`kSecAttrAccessible`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/ksecattraccessible?language=objc)\nkey is set to\n[`kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/ksecattraccessibleafterfirstunlockthisdeviceonly?language=objc)\nin order to allow background access after initial device unlock following a\nrestart.  A [keyed archive](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nskeyedarchiver?language=objc)\nrepresentation of the relevant `GTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization` instance is supplied as the value for\n[`kSecValueData`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/ksecvaluedata?language=objc)\nand this is encrypted and stored by\n[Keychain Services](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services?language=objc).\n\nFor macOS, two Keychain storage options are available: the traditional file-based Keychain storage\nwhich uses access control lists and the more modern [data protection keychain storage](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/ksecusedataprotectionkeychain?language=objc)\nwhich uses Keychain access control groups. By default, GTMAppAuth uses the file-based Keychain storage on macOS.  You may opt into using data protection keychain storage by using the parameter\n`useDataProtectionKeychain:YES` in your method calls.  Note that Keychain items stored via one\nstorage type will not be available via the other and macOS apps that choose to use the data\nprotection Keychain will need to be signed in order for Keychain operations to succeed.\n\n#### GTMOAuth2 Compatibility\n\nTo assist the migration from GTMOAuth2 to GTMAppAuth, GTMOAuth2-compatible\nKeychain methods are provided in `GTMOAuth2KeychainCompatibility`.\n\n```objc\n// Restore from Keychain\nGTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization *auth =\n    [GTMOAuth2KeychainCompatibility authForGoogleFromKeychainForName:kKeychainItemName\n                                                            clientID:clientID\n                                                        clientSecret:clientSecret];\n\n// Remove from Keychain\n[GTMOAuth2KeychainCompatibility removeAuthFromKeychainForName:kKeychainItemName];\n```\n\nYou can also save to GTMOAuth2 format, though this is discouraged (you\nshould save in GTMAppAuth format as described above).\n\n```objc\n// Save to Keychain\n[GTMOAuth2KeychainCompatibility saveAuthToKeychainForName:kKeychainItemName\n                                           authentication:authorization];\n```\n\n## Included Samples\n\nTry out one of the included sample apps under [Examples](Examples). In the\napps folder run `pod install`, then open the resulting `xcworkspace` file.\n\nBe sure to follow the instructions in\n[Example-iOS/README.md](Examples/Example-iOS/README.md) or\n[Example-macOS/README.md](Examples/Example-macOS/README.md) to configure\nyour own OAuth client ID for use with the example.\n\n## Differences with GTMOAuth2\n\n### Authorization Method\n\nGTMAppAuth uses the browser to present the authorization request, while\nGTMOAuth2 uses an embedded web-view. Migrating to GTMAppAuth will require you\nto change how you authorize the user. Follow the instructions above to get the\nauthorization.  You can then create a `GTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization` object\nwith the `initWithAuthState:authState` initializer.\n\nOnce you have the `GTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization` you can continue to make REST\ncalls as before.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nGTMAppAuth's error handling is also different. There are no notifications,\ninstead you need to inspect NSError in the callback. If the error domain is\n`OIDOAuthTokenErrorDomain`, it indicates an authorization error, you should\nclear your authorization state and consider prompting the user to authorize\nagain.  Other errors are generally considered transient, meaning that you should\nretry the request after a delay.\n\n### Serialization\n\nThe serialization format is different between GTMOAuth2 and GTMAppAuth, though\nwe have methods to help you migrate from one to the other without losing any\ndata.\n\n## Migrating from GTMOAuth2\n\n### OAuth Client Registration\n\nTypically, GTMOAuth2 clients are registered with Google as type \"Other\". This is\ncorrect for macOS, but on iOS clients should be registered with the type \"iOS\".\n\nIf you're migrating an iOS client, in the *same project as your existing client*,\n[register a new iOS client](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?project=_)\nto be used with GTMAppAuth.\n\n### Changing your Authorization Flows\n\nBoth GTMOAuth2 and GTMAppAuth support the `GTMFetcherAuthorizationProtocol`\nallowing you to use the authorization with the session fetcher.  Where you\npreviously had a property like `GTMOAuth2Authentication *authorization` change the\ntype to reference the protocol instead, i.e.:\n`id<GTMFetcherAuthorizationProtocol> authorization`.  This allows you to switch\nthe authorization implementation under the hood to GTMAppAuth.\n\nThen, follow the instructions above to replace authorization request\n(where you ask the user to grant access) with the GTMAppAuth approach. If you\ncreated a new OAuth client, use that for these requests.\n\n### Serialization & Migrating Existing Grants\n\nGTMAppAuth has a new data format and APIs for serialization. Unlike\nGTMOAuth2, GTMAppAuth serializes the configuration and history of the\nauthorization, including the client id, and a record of the authorization\nrequest that resulted in the authorization grant.\n\nThe client ID used for GTMAppAuth is [different](#oauth-client-registration) to\nthe one used for GTMOAuth2. In order to keep track of the different client ids\nused for new and old grants, it's recommended to migrate to the new\nserialization format, which will store that for you. \n[GTMOAuth2-compatible serialization](#gtmoauth2-compatible-serialization) is\nalso offered, but not fully supported.\n\nChange how you serialize your `authorization` object using the new methods\nusing the following example.\n\n```objc\n// Serialize to Keychain\n[GTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization saveAuthorization:(GTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization *)authorization\n                                toKeychainForName:kNewKeychainName];\n```\n\nBe sure to use a *new* name for the keychain. Don't reuse your old one!\n\nFor deserializing, we can preserve all existing grants (so users who authorized\nyour app in GTMOAuth2 don't have to authorize it again). Remember that when\ndeserializing the *old* data you need to use your *old* keychain name, and\nthe old client id and client secret (if those changed), and that when \nserializing to the *new* format, use the *new* keychain name.\nOnce again, pay particular care to use the old details when deserializing the\nGTMOAuth2 keychain, and the new details for all other GTMAppAuth calls.\n\nKeychain migration example:\n\n```objc\n// Attempt to deserialize from Keychain in GTMAppAuth format.\nid<GTMFetcherAuthorizationProtocol> authorization =\n    [GTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization authorizationFromKeychainForName:kNewKeychainName];\n\n// If no data found in the new format, try to deserialize data from GTMOAuth2\nif (!authorization) {\n  // Tries to load the data serialized by GTMOAuth2 using old keychain name.\n  // If you created a new client id, be sure to use the *previous* client id and secret here.\n  authorization =\n      [GTMOAuth2KeychainCompatibility authForGoogleFromKeychainForName:kPreviousKeychainName\n                                                              clientID:kPreviousClientID\n                                                          clientSecret:kPreviousClientSecret];\n  if (authorization) {\n    // Remove previously stored GTMOAuth2-formatted data.\n    [GTMOAuth2KeychainCompatibility removeAuthFromKeychainForName:kPreviousKeychainName];\n    // Serialize to Keychain in GTMAppAuth format.\n    [GTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization saveAuthorization:(GTMAppAuthFetcherAuthorization *)authorization\n                                    toKeychainForName:kNewKeychainName];\n  }\n}\n```\n"

  "readme_contents": "Introduction\n============\n\npa-applet is a systray-applet that allows you to control some of\nPulseAudio's[1] features. More specifically, pa-applet allows you to control\nthe volume level of the default sink and mute or unmute it. It also allows you\nto change the active profile of the default sink, which can be useful to tell\nPulseAudio to redirect audio to the HDMI output instead of outputting to the\nbuilt-in speakers in a computer connected to an HDMI device.\n\npa-applet is not meant as a replacement to padevchooser[2] or pavucontrol[3],\nwhich are much more feature-complete projects. pa-applet offers a more limited\nfeature set, but in a nicer shell, more appropriate for regular desktop usage.\n\nNote that this project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the PulseAudio\nproject.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1]: http://www.pulseaudio.org/\n[2]: http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/padevchooser/\n[3]: http://freedesktop.org/software/pulseaudio/pavucontrol\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nIt may sound obvious, but you need to be using PulseAudio in order to use\npa-applet. At the time of this writing, most Linux distributions seem to ship\nPulseAudio as the default sound server. Please check your distribution's\nsupport channels if in doubt.\n\nThe volume level can be adjusted in the volume slider that pops up when the\ntray icon is clicked. Alternatively, you can hover the tray icon with the\nmouse pointer and use the mouse \"wheel\" to adjust the volume level (you can\nalso use your touchpad or any other configured pointing device).\n\nThe volume keys in your keyboard can also be used to tune the volume up or\ndown. If you have a notification daemon running (such as notify-osd), a\nnotification should pop up to give you visual feedback on the volume level\nbeing adjusted.\n\nThe active profile for the card associated with the default sink can be\nchanged by clicking the tray icon with the right mouse button. This allows you\nto pick a different active profile from a list. If you have multiple audio\nports (such as an HDMI port in a laptop), you can often redirect the audio\noutput to that port by changing to the right profile.\n\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\npa-applet can be configured through simple command line arguments. For\ninformation on how pa-applet can be invoked from the command line, please\nrefer to pa-applet(1).\n\n\nFuture goals\n============\n\nWe might want to import functionality from padevchooser or even pavucontrol if\nit makes sense to do so. One example is the ability to choose the default sink\nand source, or to control the volume level of the default source. It could be\ninteresting to allow control of individual channels, but it's also a UI\nchallenge.\n\nOther notification and desktop indicator APIs are being developed, and we\nshould be able to support them as they mature. Wayland support would be nice\nas well.\n\nWe can also work on translating pa-applet. There are very few strings, so we\nshould be able to easily support many languages.\n\n\nReporting bugs\n==============\n\nPlease use the GitHub issue tracker to post bug reports. If the issue hasn't\nbeen reported yet and you have a patch, you might skip that step and send me\nthe patch directly and I'll apply it as soon as possible.\n\n\nContributing\n============\n\nAny help is appreciated, please feel free to contribute. I'll review your\npatches and commit them if they are in accordance with this project's goals,\nand you'll be credited for the changes (I may ask you to change a few things\nthings before your patches are accepted, though).\n\nFor the time being, send your patches to:\n\nFernando Tarl\u00e1 Cardoso Lemos <fernandotcl AT gmail.com>\n\nPlease format your patches with \"git format-patch\" and then attach them to an\ne-mail instead of sending the patches inlined in the message. This makes it\neasier for me to apply them.\n\nAnother option is to fork the project on GitHub and send me pull requests.\n\nIf you want to implement a new feature, please ping me first so that we can\ndiscuss it and also so that we don't end up implementing the same thing twice.\n\n\nAuthors\n=======\n\npa-applet was created by:\n\nFernando Tarl\u00e1 Cardoso Lemos <fernandotcl AT gmail.com>\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Apple Pay JS Example Integration\n\n[![Build status](https://github.com/justeat/ApplePayJSSample/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)](https://github.com/justeat/ApplePayJSSample/actions?query=workflow%3Abuild+branch%3Amain+event%3Apush)\n\nThis repository contains a sample implementation of [Apple Pay JS](https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs/) using ASP.NET Core 6 written in C# and JavaScript.\n\n## Overview\n\nApple Pay JS is a way of accepting Apple Pay in websites using Safari in either iOS 10 and macOS for users who have a TouchID compatible device.\n\nThis example integration shows a minimal sample of how to integrate Apple Pay into a webpage to obtain an Apple Pay token that can be used to capture funds for a user for goods and services.\n\nThe key components to look at for the implementation are:\n\n* ```src\\ApplePayJS\\Views\\Home\\Index.cshtml``` - The view that renders the Apple Pay button.\n* ```src\\ApplePayJS\\wwwroot\\css\\site.css``` - The CSS used to style the Apple Pay button.\n* ```src\\ApplePayJS\\wwwroot\\js\\site.js``` - The JavaScript that performs the majority of the Apple Pay functionality.\n* ```src\\ApplePayJS\\Controllers\\HomeController.cs``` - The controller that performs the POST to the Apple Pay service to verify a merchant session.\n\n## Setup\n\nTo setup the repository to run the sample, perform the steps below:\n\n  1. Install the latest [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core), Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code.\n  1. Fork this repository.\n  1. Clone the repository from your fork to your local machine: ```git clone https://github.com/{username}/ApplePayJSSample.git```\n  1. Restore the Bower, npm and NuGet packages.\n  1. [Follow the steps](https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs#2193397) to obtain your Apple Pay Merchant ID, Payment Processing Certificate, Domain Verification file and Merchant Identity Certificate if you do not already have them.\n  1. Place the Domain Verification file (```apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association```) in the ```src\\ApplePayJS\\wwwroot\\.well-known``` folder.\n  1. Generate a ```.pfx``` file from your Merchant Identity Certificate (```merchant_id.cer```, which is the public key) and the Certificate Signing Request (```your_file_name.csr```, which is the private key) that you used to generate it.\n  1. Either add your ```.pfx``` file to the root of the application in ```src\\ApplePayJS``` (but **not** in the ```wwwroot``` folder) or install it into the local certificate store.\n  1. Update the Apple touch icon (```src\\ApplePayJS\\wwwroot\\apple-touch-icon.png```) and favicon (```src\\ApplePayJS\\wwwroot\\favicon.ico```) to your own designs.\n  1. Configure the following settings as appropriate in either your environment variables or in ```src\\ApplePayJS\\appsettings.json```:\n      * ```ApplePay:StoreName```\n      * ```ApplePay:UseCertificateStore```\n      * ```ApplePay:MerchantCertificateThumbprint``` or ```ApplePay:MerchantCertificateFileName```\n  1. Configure the following setting in either your environment variables, your [user secrets](https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/security/app-secrets.html#secret-manager) or in ```src\\ApplePayJS\\appsettings.json``` (**not recommended**) if loading the ```.pfx``` file from disk (i.e. ```ApplePay:UseCertificateStore=false```):\n      * ```ApplePay:MerchantCertificatePassword```\n  1. Deploy the application to the hosting environment for the domain where you wish to use Apple Pay JS.\n  1. Verify the domain in the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/).\n\nYou should now be able to perform Apple Pay JS transactions on the deployed application.\n\n## Local Debugging\n\nYou should be able to debug the application in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).\n\n## Azure App Service Deployment\n\nIf you are deploying the sample application to a Microsoft Azure App Service Web App, you will need to make the following configuration changes to your Web App for the sample application to run correctly:\n\n* Navigate to the _Private Key Certificates (.pfx)_ tab of your Web App's _TLS/SSL Settings_ blade and upload your Apple Merchant certificate as a `.pfx` file, making a note of the _Thumbprint_ value.\n* Navigate to the _Configuration_ blade of your Web App and add the following settings:\n  * **WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES** to the value of _Thumbprint_ you noted above.\n  * **ApplePay:MerchantCertificateThumbprint** to the value of _Thumbprint_ you noted above.\n  * **ApplePay:UseCertificateStore** to the value of _true_.\n  * Save the changes.\n* Ensure the hostname you are using (either ```{yourappname}.azurewebsites.net``` or a custom hostname that you have set up) has been added in the Apple Developer portal to your merchant ID and you've added the Apple Pay domain validation file as described in the _Setup_ section above.\n\n## Feedback\n\nAny feedback or issues can be added to the [issues](https://github.com/justeat/ApplePayJSSample/issues) for this project in GitHub.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/justeat/ApplePayJSSample/blob/main/LICENSE) license.\n\n## External Links\n\n* [Apple Pay JS](https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs)\n* [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/)\n"

Upgrade your music experience with themes, styles, custom scripting, personalized settings, friends, followers and more. Built on [macOS Monterey](https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey-preview/) with backwards compatibility in-mind.\n\n## Coming Soon <sup>v2</sup>\nBrace yourselves, a major update is coming to Ultra! I've completely redesigned the codebase, added further functionality and freedom with custom scripting, as well as UI customization. Furthermore, I'm in the process of implementing a Spotify-like social feed that'll allow you to keep up with what your [\uf8ffMusic friends](https://github.com/revblaze/AppleMusicFriends) are listening to. \n\nThe current project, along with this README, need a complete rework. Since many of you have been waiting patiently \u2013 over the past year and a little bit \u2013 for the next release, I will be priortizing the publication of the standalone Ultra v2 app. The programmatic documentation will follow soon after.\n\nIn the meantime, feel free to checkout [\uf8ffMusic Friends](https://github.com/revblaze/AppleMusicFriends). Any contribution is welcome and greatly appreciated!\n\n## [Download Latest Stable Build](https://github.com/revblaze/AppleMusicUltra/releases/download/v1.0-beta.1/Themes-v1.0b1.zip) <sup>(macOS 10.12 and higher)</sup>\n`Themes-v1.0b1.zip (25MB) Public Beta 1` (April 17, 2020)\n\nDrag & drop to `/Applications` if you want to keep it after trying. \ud83e\udd17\n\n<sup>Updating from an older version? Drag and drop to `/Applications` and click `Replace`.</sup>\n\n# Customization\nPersonalize your music experience with the **Customizer**. User-selectable images, videos, web content and more.\n\n![Apple Music Ultra](Media/Themes.gif)\n\nUltra for \uf8ffMusic is a highly-customizable client. This project started as more of a POC for two-way communicable scripting through WebKit using both JavaScript and native Swift. Since then, it has become a fun little side-project.\n\n![Apple Music Ultra](Media/UIComparison.jpg)\n\nPersonalizing the experience was a major inspiration for Ultra. When I first approach a project (with a UI), the presentation and appearance is a major priority for me. Especially with an app such as \uf8ffMusic \u2013\u00a0that is heavily used with a high retention rate \u2013 the lack of customization was enough for me to start anew.\n\n# \uf8ffMusic 2 <sup><sup>BETA</sup></sup>\n\nStart using the new \uf8ffMusic without having to install the macOS 11 Big Sur beta.\n\n![Apple Music Ultra](Media/Artwork.gif)\n\nUltra is set to the AMWP beta by default. You can change this in `Configuration > MusicPlayer > Music.swift`\n\n```\nstatic let url = Service.appleBeta.url     // Latest Beta Release\nstatic let url = Service.apple.url         // Latest Public Release\n```\n\nSee `.url` in the `Service` enum at the bottom of **Music.swift** for more details.\n\n\n# The Customizer\n\nThe **Customizer** allows you to browse and apply themes using images, video and/or web animation. It also allows you to apply styles \u2013 which essentially manages the transparency, vibrancy and blurring effects for both `.light` and `.dark` modes (using `NSAppearance`).\n\n![Apple Music Ultra](Media/Themes.jpg)\n\n**Note:** Since its last major update in June 2020, I have decided to transition Ultra away from `Theme` presentation through individual, native objects such as `NSImageView` and `AVPlayerView`. Instead, I have decided to transition towards one, universal object that is capable of presenting all `ThemeTypes`: `WKWebView`.\n\nIf I find that the `WKWebView` requires a considerable amount of power \u2013 or anything that impacts performance/energy\u00a0\u2013 I will provide these native objects as an alternative method of presentation in the future. I have yet to compare the impacts of either. Please feel free to do so yourself and present your results as an [issue](https://github.com/revblaze/Ultra/issues).\n\n\n## Customizer: Themes\n\nLiven up your music experience with the <strong>Ultra Visualizer <sup>BETA</sup></strong>. Test these new dynamic themes by going to the main menu and selecting `Customize \u2192 Themes \u2192 Visualizer`.\n\n![Ultra Visualizer](Media/Gradient.gif)\n<sub>The Dynamic Gradient `Theme` created with HTML5/CSS3 animations and presented through `fxWebView` using `ThemeType.webContent`.</sub>\n\n### `Theme`\n - **name:** `String` literal of the theme name\n - **type:** `ThemeType` object to display in the `fxWebView`\n - **raw:** `String` literal of the content source (dependent on `ThemeType`)\n - **style:** `Style` object that sets the window appearance\n - **isTransparent:** `Bool` that handles `fxWebView.isHidden` and `blurView.blendingMode`\n \nNote that `Style` is just another attribute of `Theme`. This is so that `Theme` can be easily packaged for saving, as well as being extracted as a single object.\n\n### `ThemeType`\n  - `.image`: A still image that is preferably colourful and low resolution/quality\n  - `.video`: A WebKit-friendly video that is streamable from a raw URL (`/video.mov`)\n  - `.webContent`: Custom web pages that are used to present HTML5/CSS3 animations\n  - `.custom`: User-selected media file (local or URL) to be displayed using `.image` or `.video`\n\n## Dynamic Themes: Visualizer <sup>BETA</sup>\nSince both `.video` and `.webContent` types have the same resulting effect to the end-user, they are being grouped as **Dynamic Themes**. You may see me using the terms interchangeably. Furthermore, due to the iTunes visualizer being discontinued, I thought it only appropriate to *market* dynamic themes under the term: **Visualizer**. You may also see me using this word interchangeably.\n\n`TL;DR: visualizer == dynamic == (.video || .webContent)`\n\nThese dynamic themes use a combination of HTML5/CSS3 animations, as well as highly compressed video (preferably H.265 in an HEVC container). The resulting animations are presented beneath the standard blurring and vibrancy effects of `blurView: NSVisualEffectsView`. Thus, due to the finite detail required from these resources, it is recommended that you follow these standards: \n\n### `.video`\n - Low quality, low resolution and high compression\n - Bright, vibrant colours\n - Short in length (`< 20s`)\n - Loop-ready if possible\n\nSince everything in `fxWebView` has a blurry, somewhat-dence overlay effect (`NSVisualEffectsView`) \u2013 efficiency, performance and limiting resource demand is key. You do not need a fully-detailed, 1080p video with mediocre compression to act as a dynamic effect. Your videos should only provide what is necessary to get the desired effect.\n\n#### `.video` Example\n\nTake my dynamic video theme, Kaleidoscope, as an example. You can find the raw video file that is streamed to Ultra [here](https://visualizer.muza.io/videos/kscope.mov).\n\n`kscope.mov` is a `1.7MB` video file that is about `4s` long, with dimensions `640x360`. Furthermore, I edited the video to loop perfectly (although, due to the density of `blurView`, perfection is not required).\n\n#### Understanding `.video` Presentation\n\nHead on over to `Themes > ThemeHTML.swift`. As you can see with `videoHTML(_ :)`, the HTML needed to play a video in `fxWebView` is **1 line of code**.\n\n```\nstatic func videoHTML(_ urlString: String) -> String {\n  let html = \"<body style=\\\"margin: 0px; background-color: black;\\\"><video autoplay playsinline loop height=\\\"100%\\\"  src=\\\"\\(urlString)\\\"> </video>\"\n  return html\n}\n```\n\nYou don't need to have WebDev experience to understand what this line of code does. It simply takes the most minimal approach of playing a fullscreen video, within a `WKWebView`, using the WebKit standards. The `autoplay` and `playsinline` attributes allow for the video to start playing automatically and at the custom `height` set (`100% = max`). The `NSWindowController` will ensure that the following rule is met in most scenerios: `window.height <= window.length` (the window will never be taller than it is wider). Thus, it only makes sense to set the maximum height and leave width to `auto`.\n\nThe `loop` attribute allows the video to seamlessly autoplay in exactly that: a loop. If you want the dynamic theme to feel fluent and continuous - and not like a seconds-long clip on repeat - the video needs to have somewhat of a looping feel. If you have a short, small video file that you'd like to use as a dynamic theme, there are ways of creating a looping-effect without any real AV work. Online services like [ezgif.com](https://ezgif.com) will essentially take your video, double its length, and put the second half of said video in reverse. This will create an effect similar to the GIF you see in the [Music 2 section](#music-2-beta) above.\n\nFunnily enough, the Kaleidoscope video was originally an HTML5/CSS3 animation that demanded too many resources when run in the background `fxWebView`. So instead, I opened up QuickTime Player, started a screen recording and used the built-in Trim function to end the video somewhere close to how it looked at the start.\n\nVoila! You've created a looping animation in about 2 minutes.\n\n### `.webContent`\n - Low resource demand\n - Vibrant and colourful\n \nThe `.webContent` type is exactly that: web content. I found that simple CSS3 animations demanded **far** less resources than a `.video` type would. However, upon exploring more complex animations, it slowed the client down considerably. With these complex animations running in `fxWebView`, my Mac would start to heat up and the lag of simply scrolling through AMWP was unbearable. After all, the top-layer `webView` is essentially presenting a transparent render of AMWP. Adding in another graphically-demanding visual will bring the client to a hault. \n\nThe Kaleidoscope theme vs. Gradient theme is a perfect example of choosing efficiency. When the Kaleidoscope CSS3 animation caused the client to lag, I simply recorded it as a local file in Safari. With some minor modifications, the animation was running smoothly as a `.video`. It's all about finding the right balance.\n\nI do plan on testing for the most efficient method of presentation \u2013 taking performance, battery life and efficiency into account.\n\n#### `.webContent` Example\n\nThe Dynamic Gradient theme is a lot more straight-forward. This file is so small that I was able to include it, locally, within the project. It took three lines of CSS to accomplish (Technically one line, but who's counting? The compiler? Oh):\n\n```\n.css-gradient { background: linear-gradient(270deg, #ee7752, #e73c7e, #6314e6, #0960f2, #23d5ab); background-size: 1000% 1000%; -webkit-animation: Gradient 40s ease infinite; animation: Gradient 40s ease infinite; }\n@-webkit-keyframes Gradient { 0%{background-position:0% 50%} 50%{background-position:100% 50%} 100%{background-position:0% 50%} }\n@keyframes Gradient { 0%{background-position:0% 50%} 50%{background-position:100% 50%} 100%{background-position:0% 50%} }\n```\n\nMore Visualizer effects are on the way!\n\n## Customizer: Styles\n![Apple Music Ultra](Media/Styles.gif)\n\nThere are currently 7 styles to choose from, each with its own `NSVisualEffectsView.material` value.\n\n### `Style`\n```\n           Material              Appearance       Intensity\npreset:    .appearanceBased      .system            70%\nfrosty:    .sheet                .light             80%\nbright:    .mediumLight          .light             50%\nenergy:    .light                .light             30%\ncloudy:    .ultraDark            .dark              80%\nshadow:    .toolTip              .dark              50%\nvibing:    .dark                 .dark              30%\n```\n\nStyles are the top-layer effects that overlay the `fxWebView`, as well as determine `.light` or `.dark` appearance modes. Using `Theme.style`, they can be set to overlap your object-based theme to add some vibrant effects; or alternatively, they can be set to blur your system background using `Theme.isTransparent = true`.\n\n## Custom Themes <sup>Temporarily Disabled</sup>\n![Apple Music Ultra](Media/Custom.gif)\nSetting a custom, user-selected image is as simple as prompting the user for the `URL` path of their `file://` and setting it as the `media` property.\n\n```\nlet imageURL = selectImageFile()\nsetTheme(NSVisualEffectView.Material, darkMode: Bool, media: imageURL, type: \"image\")\n```\n```\nfunc selectImageFile() -> URL {\n    let dialog = NSOpenPanel()\n    dialog.allowsMultipleSelection = false\n    dialog.allowedFileTypes = [\"png\", \"jpg\", \"jpeg\"]\n    \n    if (dialog.runModal() == NSApplication.ModalResponse.OK) {\n        if let result = dialog.url?.absoluteURL { return result }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Appearance\nAppearance modes are now an attribute of `Style`. \n```\nStyle.get().isDark      // Returns the active Style appearance mode\nTheme.style.isDark      // Returns the active Theme appearance mode\n```\n\nJust wanted to give a shout out to the devs behind the Web Player for designing this beautiful web app. The design of the UI seems to conform to its containers' `AppleInterfaceStyle`. Meaning everything in the web app has a Light mode and Dark mode property and conforms to whatever the `Style` object is set to.\n\nThus, this property's main function is to toggle the Light/Dark mode of AMWP, as well as the entire application as a whole.\n\n### ViewController Overview <sup>back to front</sup>\n\n- **FXWebView:** `WKWebView` that displays all `Theme` content using local HTML (specific to `ThemeType`)\n  - `if Theme.isTransparent { fxWebView.isHidden = true }`\n- **BlurView:** `NSVisualEffectsView` that presents the window `Style`\n- **WebView:** `WKWebView` presents and interacts with AMWP through JavaScript\n- **CustomizerView:** `embedded NSView` that presents CustomizerViewController\n  - CustomizerViewController utilizes the [WKScriptMessageHandler](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkscriptmessagehandler) protocol for communicating global `Theme` and `Style` updates upon selection\n\n# WKWebView\nTODO: Write this out.\n\n## JavaScript Injection\nTODO: Write this out.\n\n# Branches\n\n - **alpha:** The original Ultra for Apple Music build\n     - Prior to restructuring the Themes & Style code and adding the new Customizer from private repository\n - **legacy:** Ultra for Apple Music with support for macOS 10.13 and below\n - **webkit/fx:** All effects (static and dynamic) done through a single WebKit manager\n - ~~**beta:**~~ *(retired)* The nightly builds for the current master that will replace the alpha build as master\n - ~~**lite/musish:**~~ *(retired)* Ultra <sup>LITE</sup> for <a href=\"https://musi.sh/\">Musish</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/Musish/Musish\">GitHub</a>)\n\n**Note:** The master branch has recently been replaced with newer code for better integration with Big Sur. The previous code (August 2020) is still available and has been moved to the `alpha` branch. The previous code was mashed together and added-to when my free time was available. In short, it's a mess.\n\nI am still in the process of rewriting and restructuring the new code as I learn better, more efficient ways of doing things. I will do my best to update the README and documentation as progress is made. Again, this is just a side-project. I will only be adding to it when I have free time available. If I want to implement a fun new feature that I think users will enjoy, I will prioritize that over cleaning and restructuring \u2013 as this is a side-project. Thank you for your patience!\n\n## Requirements\nRequires macOS 10.12 or later.\n\n<sub><i>Please note that the app is being built with Swift 5.2</i></sub>\n\nThis app is currently under heavy development. Expect major structural changes.\n"

  "repo": "hmaidasani/RadialChartImageGenerator",
  "language": "JavaScript",
  "readme_contents": "# RadialChartImageGenerator\nA simple tool that generates images for animating radial or circular progress charts for the Apple Watch and WatchKit. The charts are referred to as rings, dials, radials or circles.\n\n![animation1](docs/animate1.gif) ![animation2](docs/animate2.gif) ![animation3](docs/animate3.gif)\n\n## Overview\n\n#### Why care about radial progress charts?\n* Clearly, Apple likes radial progress charts which are used in their activity monitor health watch app ([Apple Health & Fitness Watch App](https://www.apple.com/watch/health-and-fitness/)).\n\n* Radial charts are just the right way to display a large amount of data on such a small screen size.\n\n* We as humans have been trained to read radial progress charts from a very young age - clocks. That's why it makes a lot of sense to use them on a watch.\n\n#### Why use the RadialChartImageGenerator?\n\n* The Apple WatchKit SDK does not have a built-in tool or library to create these charts or any visualization.\n\n* The way Apple WatchKit SDK allows animations or visualizations is to use a sequence of static images ([WatchKit Design Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/WatchHumanInterfaceGuidelines/Animation.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014992-CH7-SW1)). In fact, Apple's own WatchKit sample app called [Lister](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/samplecode/Lister/Introduction/Intro.html) does animations of this radial progress chart using 360 different static images of the chart. The reason for this is that drawing pixels or shapes would require a lot of computation and drain the battery of the watch.  So, good luck creating hundreds of images by yourself. \n\n* The RadialChartImageGenerator comes in to the rescue. With a few clicks, you can select whether you want a single, double, or triple arc radial chart (images shown above), customize the colors and text, and choose how many values or capacity the chart should have. The generator will finally generate every permutation of the radial progress chart and download a zip file with all the images. The alternative is to create these images manually in an image editor program like Photoshop, which would require a lot of effort and time. The RadialChartImageGenerator is a very simple tool that saves so much time with minimal effort. \n\n## How To Use\n\n#### Instructions\n\n1. Go to http://hmaidasani.github.io/RadialChartImageGenerator/ or open index.html (Chrome and Firefox recommended).\n\n2. Decide on whether you need a single, double, or triple arc radial chart.\n![animation1](docs/how-to-2.png)\n\n3. Choose the max value or the capacity of the appropriate arc.\n![animation2](docs/how-to-3.gif)\n\n4. Choose the arc background color.\n![animation3](docs/how-to-4.gif)\n\n5. Decide the color scheme for each appropriate arc. If you would like a gradient color scheme, choose three different colors for the foreground start, mid, and end colors. In order to see how this looks, choose the current value to be equal to the max value to see the full arc gradient. **Note: the current value has no effect on the output of the images - it is merely there to see how the arc would look at a given value.**\n![animation4](docs/how-to-5.gif)\n\n6. For the single arc, you may select if text should appear in the center. You may also select the text color and the units of the subtext.\n![animation5](docs/how-to-6.gif)\n\n7. Once you have modified each arc to your preference, click the Generate Images button to generate each permutation of images for the given arc structure. Enter the filename prefix of your choice and click on Continue. The double and triple arcs images can optionally be merged to have all the arc layers combined into a single image. The preferred method is to download the arc layers separately.\n![animation6](docs/how-to-7.gif)\n\n8. The images should download in a zip file.\n\n9. Repeat for all the other arcs if needed.\n\n10. Import the downloaded images into your WatchKit Xcode project. The below example projects show how this is done.\n\n#### Examples\n\nHere are some sample WatchKit apps using the images generated using the RadialChartImageGenerator. Note: the most recent version of Xcode is required to run these.\n\n* Simple single arc app - [Radial - Single Arc.zip](https://github.com/hmaidasani/RadialChartImageGenerator/blob/master/examples/Radial%20-%20Single%20Arc.zip?raw=true)\n\n* Simple triple arc app - [Radial - Triple Arc.zip](https://github.com/hmaidasani/RadialChartImageGenerator/blob/master/examples/Radial%20-%20Triple%20Arc.zip?raw=true)\n\n* Health and Activity app - [Health.zip](https://github.com/hmaidasani/RadialChartImageGenerator/blob/master/examples/Health.zip?raw=true)\n\n## Questions & Feature Requests\n\nReport all of your questions and feature requests to the issues section of git repository.\n"

Windows supports it starting with Windows 10 Anniversary\nUpdate in Chome and Edge.  On macOS, only Chrome supports it, while on Linux it will\nsupport it with some fontconfig tweaking.\n\n## Color emoji assets\n\nThe assets provided in the repo are all those used to build the AppleColorEmoji\nfont.  Note however that AppleColorEmoji often uses the same assets to represent\ndifferent character sequences-- notably, most gender-neutral characters or\nsequences are represented using assets named after one of the gendered\nsequences.  This means that some sequences appear to be missing.  Definitions of\nthe aliasing used appear in the `emoji_aliases.txt` file.\n\nAlso note that the images in the font might differ from the original assets.  In\nparticular the flag images in the font are PNG images to which transforms have\nbeen applied to standardize the size and generate the wave and border shadow.  We\ndo not have SVG versions that reflect these transforms.\n\n## Related\n- [Apple Color Emoji for Slack on Linux](https://github.com/samuelngs/slack-apple-emoji-linux)\n\n## Credits\n\n- https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-emoji\n- https://github.com/googlei18n/nototools\n\n## License\n\n- Emoji fonts (under the fonts subdirectory) are under the [SIL Open Font License, version 1.1](fonts/LICENSE).\n- Tools and some image resources are under the [Apache license, version 2.0](./LICENSE).\n"

  "readme_contents": "# WinAppleKey\n\nApple Magic Keyboard (A1644) driver for Windows 10. Note: this driver is not for the older A1314 model or any other models.\n\nFeafures: \n- Swaps the Fn-Ctrl keys to align with standard Windows keyboard layouts (fearture not supported by Apple's Bootcamp driver).\n- Maps the missing Windows keys such as the Del, Insert, Print Screen, Pause/Break, etc.\n\n### Technical Details\n\nWinAppleKey is implemented as a HIDCLASS LowerFilter WDM kernel mode driver. \n\n![keyboard-driver-stack](keyboard-driver-stack.png)\n\n### Installation\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** This driver is signed with a self-signed (test/development) certificate. For that reason, Windows will not allow the driver installation unless running in **TESTSIGNING** mode. Please be aware that permanently running Windows in **TESTSIGNING** mode leaves your system open to potential security risks. Any consequence because of this is solely your own responsibility. WinAppleKey is ***free software*** that you are willing to build and/or use completely ***at your own risk.*** If your system is running a UEFI BIOS with **Secure Boot** enabled, you will need to disable **Secure Boot** in BIOS first before enabling **TESTSIGNING** mode.\n\nTo switch to **TESTSIGNING** mode issue the following command (in an Administrative command prompt) and then reboot your PC: \n\n``` bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING ON ```\n\nYou can now run the *Setup.msi* installer.\n\nTo uninstall, run the uninstaller from the ```Control Panel``` ```Programs``` and then manually revert TESTSIGNING mode by issuing the following command (in an Administrative command prompt):\n\n``` bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING OFF ```\n\n### Key Mapppings\n\n**WinAppleKey** creates the following key mappings:\n\n  <table>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Input Key(s)</th>\n      <th>Output Key</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><kbd>LCtrl</kbd></td><td><kbd>Fn</kbd></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><kbd>Fn</kbd></td><td><kbd>Left Ctrl</kbd></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><kbd>\u23cf\ufe0e Eject</kbd></td><td><kbd>Del</kbd></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><kbd>\u2318 Cmd</kbd></td><td><kbd>Alt</kbd></td>\n    </tr>    \n    <tr>\n      <td><kbd>\u2325 Alt</kbd></td><td><kbd>Cmd</kbd></td>\n    </tr>       \n    <tr>\n      <td><kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>[F1]</kbd>...<kbd>[F12]</kbd></td><td><kbd>[F13]</kbd>...<kbd>[F24]</kbd></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>LCtrl</kbd></td><td><kbd>Right Ctrl</kbd></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd></td><td><kbd>Insert</kbd></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd></td><td><kbd>Print Screen</kbd></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd></td><td><kbd>Scroll Lock</kbd></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd></td><td><kbd>Pause/Break</kbd></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>&uarr;</kbd></td><td><kbd>Page Up</kbd></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>&darr;</kbd></td><td><kbd>Page Down</kbd></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>&larr;</kbd></td><td><kbd>Home</kbd></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>&rarr;</kbd></td><td><kbd>End</kbd></td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n\n**Multimedia Keys:**\nThe multimedia keys are not directly mapped as they correspond to F19-F24 instead but you can easily use this [AutoHotkey script](MapMultimediaKeys.ahk) for that purpose. Please note that this currently works only over the wired connection.\n\n### Driver Settings\n\nYou can use regedit.exe to optionally modify certain driver settings.\n\nTo enable/disable the **Alt-Cmd key swapping** edit the DWORD key value: **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\WinAppleKey\\SwapAltCmd**. The default value is 0 (off).\n\nTo enable/disable the **Fn-Ctrl key swapping** edit the DWORD key value:\n**HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\WinAppleKey\\SwapFnCtrl**. The default value is 1 (on).\n\nAfter changing any of these values, you will need to disconnect/connect your associated Apple keyboard(s) to trigger a driver reload, or alternatively reboot your machine.\n\n### Build Instructions\n\nTo build the driver you will need **Visual Studio 2019** along with an installation of the \n  **Windows 10 Driver Kit (WDK)**. For the installer project, you will additionally need to install the **[WiX toolset](http://wixtoolset.org/)**. \n\n### Freequently Asked Questions\n\n*Aiming to save you some time from sending me an e-mail* :)\n\n#### 1. Will you ever release a full version (i.e. not self-signed) of the driver that does not require Windows running in TESTSIGNING mode?\nUnfortunately I can't. This is due to Microsoft enforced restrictions. In order to fully release a device driver for Windows 10 (and later) you need to run a company (Ltd.) and also purchase a driver signing certificate for that company. Both cost a significant amount of money. WinAppleKey is free and open source and I do not make any money out of it. ***But*** there is similar free software for Apple keyboards, which does not require a driver installation. It uses a custom programmed Raspberry Pi Zero W device that functions as a special USB dongle for using Apple keyboards on Windows. More info [here](https://github.com/samartzidis/RaspiKey).\n\n#### 2. How can I get the multimedia keys to work?\n\nSee paragraph **Multimedia Keys** above.\n\n#### 3. When running in the default fn-ctrl swap mode, the ctrl-lshift-t combination commonly used to reopen a closed browser tab in Chrome does not work.\n\nThis is an issue of the Apple keyboard hardware rather than the driver. You can use the ctrl-rshift-t combination instead.\n\n#### 4. I am trying to enable Test Signing mode but I get this error: ```The value is protected by Secure Boot policy and cannot be modified or deleted```.\n\nYou will need to disable Windows **Secure Boot**, please read the *Disclaimer* part.\n\n### Donate\n\n[![donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-green.svg)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=TBM5P9X6GZRCL)\n<br/>\n**Bitcoin:** bc1qecklcec0z2hzv7twf97p2tr44syw5z5aqmamrt\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Open `Preferences...` for customization options (enable `Show advanced settings` for even more options).\n7. You can set up custom keyboard shortcuts under the `Keyboard` in Preferences (the app uses Apple media keys by default).\n8. If you have any questions, go to [Discussions](https://github.com/MonitorControl/MonitorControl/discussions)!\n\n## Screenshots (Preferences)\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\".github/pref_1.png\" width=\"392\" alt=\"Screenshot\"/>\n<img src=\".github/pref_2.png\" width=\"392\" alt=\"Screenshot\"/>\n<img src=\".github/pref_3.png\" width=\"392\" alt=\"Screenshot\"/>\n<img src=\".github/pref_4.png\" width=\"392\" alt=\"Screenshot\"/>\n</div>\n\n## macOS compatibility\n\n| MonitorControl version | macOS version     |\n| ---------------------- | ----------------- |\n| v4.0.0                 | Catalina 10.15*   |\n| v3.1.1                 | Mojave 10.14      |\n| v2.1.0                 | Sierra 10.12      |\n\n_* With some limitations - full functionality available on macOS 11 Big Sur or newer._\n\n## Supported displays\n\n- Most modern LCD displays from all major manufacturers supported implemented DDC/CI protocol via DisplayPort, HDMI, USB-C or VGA to allow for hardware backlight control.\n- Apple (and LG-Apple) displays and built-in displays are supported using native protocol.\n- LCD and LED Televisions usually do not implement DDC, these are supported using software alternatives to dim the image (some higher-end sets are able to translate this into hardware backlight dimming).\n- OLED or mini/micro-LED displays and televisions are fully supported using gamma table manipulation (this is a no-compromise solution for this class of displays).\n- DisplayLink, Airplay and Sidecar are supported using shade (dark overlay) control.\n- The app is compatible with [BetterDummy](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDummy) mirrored sets.\n\nNotable exceptions for hardware control compatibility:\n\n- Some displays (notably EIZO) use MCCS over USB or an entirely custom protocol for control. These displays are supported with software dimming only.\n- The HDMI port of the 2018 Intel Mac mini and 2020 M1 Mac mini prohibit DDC communication. Software control is still available. We recommend connecting the display via the USB-C port (USB-C to HDMI dongles usually work).\n- DisplayLink docks and dongles do not allow for DDC control on Macs, only software dimming is available for these connections.\n\nNote to f.lux users - please activate `Avoid gamma table manipulation` under `Preferences` \u00bb `Displays`! This step is not needed if you use Night Shift.\n\n## How to help\n\n- You can greatly help out [by financing the project with your donation or by being a Sponsor](https://opencollective.com/monitorcontrol)!\n- Open [issues](https://github.com/MonitorControl/MonitorControl/issues) if you have a question, an enhancement to suggest or a bug you've found.\n- If you want, you can fork the code yourself and submit a pull request to improve the app (Note: accepting a PR is solely in the collective hands of the maintainers).\n\n## Localizations\n\nMonitorControl supports localization. We gladly welcome your contribution with a new language! See the [opening post of the relevant discussion](https://github.com/MonitorControl/MonitorControl/discussions/637) on how to add your translation!\n\n## How to build\n\n### Required\n\n- Xcode\n- [Swiftlint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint)\n- [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat)\n- [BartyCrouch](https://github.com/Flinesoft/BartyCrouch) (for updating localizations)\n\n### Build steps\n\n- Clone the project via this Terminal command:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/MonitorControl/MonitorControl.git\n```\n\n- If you want to clone one of the branches, add `--single-branch --branch [branchname]` after the `clone` option.\n- You're all set! Now open the `MonitorControl.xcodeproj` with Xcode! The dependencies will automatically get downloaded once you open the project. If they don't: `File > Packages > Resolve Package Versions`\n\n### Third party dependencies\n\n- [MediaKeyTap](https://github.com/MonitorControl/MediaKeyTap)\n- [Preferences](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Preferences)\n- [SimplyCoreAudio](https://github.com/rnine/SimplyCoreAudio)\n- [KeyboardShortcuts](https://github.com/sindresorhus/KeyboardShortcuts)\n- [Sparkle](https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle)\n\n## Maintainers\n\n- [@the0neyouseek](https://github.com/the0neyouseek)\n- [@JoniVR](https://github.com/JoniVR)\n- [@waydabber](https://github.com/waydabber)\n\n## Thanks\n\n- [@mathew-kurian](https://github.com/mathew-kurian/) (original developer)\n- [@Tyilo](https://github.com/Tyilo/) (fork)\n- [@Bensge](https://github.com/Bensge/) - (used some code from his project [NativeDisplayBrightness](https://github.com/Bensge/NativeDisplayBrightness))\n- [@nhurden](https://github.com/nhurden/) (for the original MediaKeyTap)\n- [@kfix](https://github.com/kfix/ddcctl) (for ddcctl)\n- [@reitermarkus](https://github.com/reitermarkus) (for Intel DDC support)\n- [@alin23](https://github.com/alin23) (generally spearheaded M1 DDC support and figured out a many of the caveats)\n- [javierocasio](https://www.deviantart.com/javierocasio) (app icon background)\n"

Bear in mind that this is written entirely in JavaScript, so please adjust your expectations. The virtual machine is emulating a 1991 Macintosh Quadra 900 with a Motorola CPU, which Apple used before switching to the PowerPC architecture (Apple/IBM/Motorola) in the mid 1990s.\n\n## Should this have been a native app?\nAbsolutely.\n\n## Does it run my favorite game or app?\nThe short answer is \"Yes\". In fact, you'll find various games and demos preinstalled, thanks to an old MacWorld Demo CD from 1997. Namely, Oregon Trail, Duke Nukem 3D, Civilization II, Alley 19 Bowling, Damage Incorporated, and Dungeons & Dragons.\n\nThere are also various apps and trials preinstalled, including Photoshop 3, Premiere 4, Illustrator 5.5, StuffIt Expander, the Apple Web Page Construction Kit, and more.\n\n## Can I transfer files from and to the machine?\n\nYes, you can. Click on the \"Help\" button at the bottom of the running app to see instructions. You can transfer files directly - or mount disk images.\n\n## Can I connect to the Internet?\n\nNo. For what it's worth, the web was quite different 30 years ago - and you wouldn't be able to open even Google. However, Internet Explorer and Netscape are installed, as is the \"Web Sharing Server\", if you want to play around a bit.\n\n## Should I use this for [serious application]?\n\nProbably not. This is a toy - it's not the best nor the most performant way to emulate an old Macintosh. It is, however, a quick and easy way to experience a bit of nostalgia if you're _not_ trying to do anything serious with it.\n\n## Credits\n\nPlease check out the [CREDITS](CREDITS.md)! This app wouldn't be possible without the hard work of [Christian Bauer](https://www.cebix.net/) and [James Friend](https://jamesfriend.com.au/), who did everything that seems like computing magic here.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is provided for educational purposes only.

  "readme_contents": "# SandBlaster: Reversing the Apple Sandbox\n\nSandBlaster is a tool for reversing (decompiling) binary Apple sandbox profiles. Apple sandbox profiles are written in SBPL (*Sandbox Profile Language*), a Scheme-like language, and are then compiled into an undocumented binary format and shipped. Primarily used on iOS, sandbox profiles are present on macOS as well. SandBlaster is, to our knowledge, the first tool that reverses binary sandbox profiles to their original SBPL format. SandBlaster works on iOS from version 7 onwards including iOS 11.\n\nThe technical report [SandBlaster: Reversing the Apple Sandbox](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04303) presents extensive (though a bit outdated) information on SandBlaster internals.\n\nSandBlaster relied on previous work by [Dionysus Blazakis](https://github.com/dionthegod/XNUSandbox) and Stefan Esser's [code](https://github.com/sektioneins/sandbox_toolkit) and [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/i0n1c/ruxcon-2014-stefan-esser-ios8-containers-sandboxes-and-entitlements).\n\nThe reverser (in the `reverse-sandbox/` folder) and the helper tool (in the `helpers/` folder) run on any Python running platform.\n\nSandBlaster may be installed and run standalone, though we recommend installing and running it from within [iExtractor](https://github.com/malus-security/iExtractor). Check the [iExtractor documentation](https://github.com/malus-security/iExtractor/blob/master/README.md) for information.\n\niExtractor is open source software released under the 3-clause BSD license.\n\n## Installation\n\nSandBlaster requires Python2 for the reverser (in `reverse-sandbox/`), Python3 with `lief` library for helper script (in `helpers/`).\n\nAfter cloning the SandBlaster repository, you have to install `lief` for Python3:\n```\npip3 install lief\n```\n\nIf the installation of `lief` fails you need compile to it. More information about how to compile it can be found on the [wiki page](https://lief.quarkslab.com/doc/stable/compilation.html).\n\n## Usage\n\nIn order to use SandBlaster you need access to the binary sandbox profiles and the sandbox operations, a set of strings that define sandbox-specific actions. Sandbox operations and sandbox profiles are extracted using the `helpers/extract_sandbox_data.py` script. Sandbox profiles are extracted from the kernel sandbox extension (as a bundle for iOS 4 and 9-11) or from kernel cache (as a bundle for iOS 12) or from the `sandboxd` file in the iOS filesystem (for iOS 5-8). Sandbox operations are extracted either from kernel extension (for iOS 4-11) or from kernel cache (for iOS 12).\n\nSo, as input data, SandBlaster requires the kernelcache, the kernel sandbox extension and the `sandboxd` file. Information and scripts on extracting them from a publicly available IPSW (*iPhone Software*) file is presented by [iExtractor](https://github.com/malus-security/iExtractor).\n\nBelow are the steps and commands to reverse the sandbox profiles for iOS 8.4.1, assuming the sandbox kernel extension (`com.apple.security.sandbox.kext`) and the `sandboxd` file are available:\n\n```\n# Extract sandbox operations from kernelcache.\ncd helpers/\n./extract_sandbox_data.py -o iPad2,1_8.4.1_12H321.sb_ops iPad2,1_8.4.1_12H321.com.apple.security.sandox.kext 8.4.1\n# Extract binary sandbox profile files from sandboxd.\nmkdir iPad2,1_8.4.1_12H321.sandbox_profiles\n./extract_sandbox_data.py -O iPad2,1_8.4.1_12H321.sandbox_profiles/ iPad2,1_8.4.1_12H321.sandboxd 8.4.1\n# Reverse all binary sandbox profiles.\ncd ../reverse-sandbox/\nmkdir iPad2,1_8.4.1_12H321.reversed_profiles\nfor i in ../helpers/iPad2,1_8.4.1_12H321.sandbox_profiles/*; do python reverse_sandbox.py -r 8.4.1 -o ../helpers/iPad2,1_8.4.1_12H321.sb_ops -d iPad2,1_8.4.1_12H321.reversed_profiles/ \"$i\"; done\n```\n\nBelow are the steps and commands to reverse the sandbox profiles for iOS 9.3, assuming the sandbox kernel extension (`com.apple.security.sandbox.kext`) is available:\n\n```\n# Extract sandbox operations from kernelcache.\ncd helpers/\n./extract_sandbox_data.py -o iPhone5,1_9.3_13E237.sb_ops iPhone5,1_9.3_13E237.com.apple.security.sandox.kext 9.3\n# Extract sandbox profile bundle from kernel sandbox extension.\n./extract_sandbox_data.py -O . iPhone5,1_9.3_13E237.com.apple.security.sandox.kext 9.3\ncd ../reverse-sandbox/\n# Reverse all binary sandbox profiles in sandbox bundle.\nmkdir iPhone5,1_9.3_13E237.reversed_profiles\n# Print all sandbox profiles in bundle.\npython reverse_sandbox.py -r 9.3 -o ../helpers/iPhone5,1_9.3_13E237.sb_ops -d iPhone5,1_9.3_13E237.reversed_profiles/ ../helpers/sandbox_bundle -psb\n# Do actual reversing.\npython reverse_sandbox.py -r 9.3 -o ../helpers/iPhone5,1_9.3_13E237.sb_ops -d iPhone5,1_9.3_13E237.reversed_profiles/ ../helpers/sandbox_bundle\n```\n\nThe extraction of the binary sandbox profiles differs between iOS <= 8 and iOS >= 9. Since iOS >= 9 the binary sandbox profiles are stored in a sandbox bundle in the kernel sandbox extension. The `helpers/extract_sandbox_data.py` script extracts them appropriately depending on the iOS version.\n\nThe `-psb` option for `reverse_sandbox.py` prints out the sandbox profiles part of a sandbox bundle without doing the actual reversing.\n\nThe `reverse_sandbox.py` script needs to be run in its directory (`reverse-sandbox/`) since it needs the other Python modules and the `logger.config` file.\n\n## Internals\n\nThe `helpers/` subfolder contains helper scripts that provide a nicer interface for the external tools.\n\nThe actual reverser is part of the `reverse-sandbox/` folder. Files here can be categorized as follows:\n\n  * The main script is `reverse_sandbox.py`. It parses the command line arguments, does basic parsing of the input binary file (extracts sections) and calls the appropriate functions from the other modules.\n  * The core of the implementation is `operation_node.py`. It provides functions to build the rules graph corresponding to the sandbox profile and to convert the graph to SBPL. It is called by `reverse_sandbox.py`.\n  * Sandbox filters (i.e. match rules inside sandbox profiles) are handled by the implementation in `sandbox_filter.py` and the configuration in `filters.json`, `filter_list.py` and `filters.py`. Filter specific functions are called by `operation_node.py`.\n  * Regular expression reversing is handled by `sandbox_regex.py` and `regex_parse.py`. `regex_parse.py` is the back end parser that converts the binary representation to a basic graph. `sandbox_regex.py` converts the graph representation (an automaton) to an actual regular expression (i.e. a string of characters and metacharacters). It is called by `reverse_sandbox.py` for parsing regular expressions, with the resulting regular expression list being passed to the functions exposed by `operation_node.py`; `operation_node.py` passes them on to sandbox filter handling files.\n  * The new format for storing strings since iOS 10 is handled by `reverse_string.py`. The primary `SandboxString` class in `reverse_string.py` is used in `sandbox_filter.py`.\n  * Logging is configured in the `logger.config` file. By default, `INFO` and higher level messages are printed to the console, while `DEBUG` and higher level messages are printed to the `reverse.log` file.\n\n## Supported iOS Versions\n\nSandBlaster works for iOS version 4 onwards including iOS 12. Apple has been making updates to the binary format of the sandbox profiles: since iOS 9 sandbox profiles are stored in a bundle, since iOS 10 strings are aggregated together in a specialied binary format. iOS 11 didn't bring any change to the format.\n\n## Community\n\nJoin us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/m3gjuyHYw9) for live discussions.\n"

  "repo": "mParticle/mparticle-apple-sdk",
  "language": "Objective-C",
  "readme_contents": "<img src=\"https://static.mparticle.com/sdk/mp_logo_black.svg\" width=\"280\">\n\n# mParticle Apple SDK\n\nThis is the mParticle Apple SDK for iOS and tvOS.\n\nAt mParticle our mission is straightforward: make it really easy for apps and app services to connect and allow you to take ownership of your 1st party data.\nLike most app owners, you end up implementing and maintaining numerous SDKs ranging from analytics, attribution, push notification, remarketing,\nmonetization, etc. However, embedding multiple 3rd party libraries creates a number of unintended consequences and hidden costs.\n\nThe mParticle platform addresses all these problems. We support an ever growing number of integrations with services and SDKs, including developer\ntools, analytics, attribution, messaging, advertising, and more. mParticle has been designed to be the central hub connecting all these services \u2013\nread the [docs](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/ios/) or contact us at <support@mparticle.com> to learn more.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis document will help you:\n\n* Install the mParticle SDK using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/?q=mparticle) or [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)\n* Add any desired [kits](#currently-supported-kits)\n* Initialize the mParticle SDK\n\n## Get the SDK\n\nThe mParticle-Apple-SDK is available via [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/?q=mparticle), [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) or [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager). Follow the instructions below based on your preference.\n\n#### CocoaPods\n\nTo integrate the SDK using CocoaPods, specify it in your [Podfile](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html):\n\n```ruby\n# Uncomment the line below if you're using Swift or would like to use dynamic frameworks (recommended but not required)\n# use_frameworks!\n\ntarget '<Your Target>' do\n    pod 'mParticle-Apple-SDK', '~> 8'\nend\n```\n\nConfiguring your `Podfile` with the statement above will include only the _Core_ mParticle SDK.\n\n> If your app targets iOS and tvOS in the same Xcode project, you need to configure the `Podfile` differently in order to use the SDK with multiple platforms. You can find an example of multi-platform configuration [here](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-apple-sdk/wiki/Multi-platform-Configuration).\n\nIf you'd like to add any kits, you can do so as follows:\n\n```ruby\n# Uncomment the line below if you're using Swift or would like to use dynamic frameworks (recommended but not required)\n# use_frameworks!\n\ntarget '<Your Target>' do\n    pod 'mParticle-Appboy', '~> 8'\n    pod 'mParticle-BranchMetrics', '~> 8'\n    pod 'mParticle-Localytics', '~> 8'\nend\n```\n\nIn the cases above, the _Appboy_, _Branch Metrics_, and _Localytics_ kits would be integrated together with the core SDK.\n\n#### Working with Static Libraries\n\nmParticle's iOS SDK and its embedded kits are [dynamic libraries](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/DynamicLibraries/100-Articles/OverviewOfDynamicLibraries.html), meaning their code is loaded into an app's address space only as needed, as opposed to a 'static' library, which is always included in full in the app's executable file. Some mParticle embedded kits rely on static libraries maintained by our partners. A static framework, wrapped in a dynamic library is incompatible with CocoaPods' `use frameworks!` option. Affected kits are: Appboy, AppsFlyer, comScore, Kahuna, Kochava, Localytics and Radar.\n\nAttempting to use these kits with `use_frameworks!` will result in the following error message:\n\n`[!] The '<your Target>' target has transitive dependencies that include static binaries: (<path to framework>)`\n\nIf you need to reference these kits' methods from user-level code, you must incorporate them manually. To do this:\n\n1. Add the partner SDK (for example, `Appboy-iOS-SDK` or `AppsFlyer-SDK`) directly to your Podfile.\n2. Remove the embedded kit pod(`mParticle-<partner name>`) from the Podfile, download the source code from Github and manually drag its `.m` and `.h` files directly into your project.\n\n#### Crash Reporter\n\nFor iOS only, you can also choose to install the crash reporter by including it as a separate pod:\n\n```ruby\npod 'mParticle-CrashReporter', '~> 1.3'\n```\n\nYou can read detailed instructions for including the Crash Reporter at its repository: [mParticle-CrashReporter](https://github.com/mParticle/mParticle-CrashReporter)\n\n> Note you can't use the crash reporter at the same time as the Apteligent kit.\n\n#### Carthage\n\nTo integrate the SDK using Carthage, specify it in your [Cartfile](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#cartfile):\n\n```ogdl\ngithub \"mparticle/mparticle-apple-sdk\" ~> 8.0\n```\n\nIf you'd like to add any kits, you can do so as follows:\n\n```ogdl\ngithub \"mparticle-integrations/mparticle-apple-integration-branchmetrics\" ~> 8.0\n```\n\nIn this case, only the _Branch Metrics_ kit would be integrated; all other kits would be left out.\n\n#### Swift Package Manager\n\nTo integrate the SDK using Swift Package Manager, open your Xcode project and navigate to File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency\n\nEnter the repository URL `https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-apple-sdk` and click Next.\n\nYou can leave the version settings as default and click Next one more time to complete adding the package dependency.\n\n#### Currently Supported Kits\n\nSeveral integrations require additional client-side add-on libraries called \"kits.\" Some kits embed other SDKs, others just contain a bit of additional functionality. Kits are designed to feel just like server-side integrations; you enable, disable, filter, sample, and otherwise tweak kits completely from the mParticle platform UI. The Core SDK will detect kits at runtime, but you need to add them as dependencies to your app.\n\nKit | CocoaPods | Carthage | Swift Package Manager

is initialized by calling the `startWithOptions` method within the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` delegate call. Preferably the location of the initialization method call should be one of the last statements in the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`. The `startWithOptions` method requires an options argument containing your key and secret and an initial Identity request.\n\n> Note that it is imperative for the SDK to be initialized in the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method. Other parts of the SDK rely on the `UIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification` notification to function properly. Failing to start the SDK as indicated will impair it. Also, please do **not** use _GCD_'s `dispatch_async` to start the SDK.\n\n#### Swift\n\n```swift\nimport mParticle_Apple_SDK\n\nfunc application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {\n        \n       // Override point for customization after application launch.\n        let mParticleOptions = MParticleOptions(key: \"<<<App Key Here>>>\", secret: \"<<<App Secret Here>>>\")\n        \n       //Please see the Identity page for more information on building this object\n        let request = MPIdentityApiRequest()\n        request.email = \"email@example.com\"\n        mParticleOptions.identifyRequest = request\n        mParticleOptions.onIdentifyComplete = { (apiResult, error) in\n            NSLog(\"Identify complete. userId = %@ error = %@\", apiResult?.user.userId.stringValue ?? \"Null User ID\", error?.localizedDescription ?? \"No Error Available\")\n        }\n        \n       //Start the SDK\n        MParticle.sharedInstance().start(with: mParticleOptions)\n        \n       return true\n}\n```\n\n#### Objective-C\n\nFor apps supporting iOS 8 and above, Apple recommends using the import syntax for **modules** or **semantic import**. However, if you prefer the traditional CocoaPods and static libraries delivery mechanism, that is fully supported as well.\n\nIf you are using mParticle as a framework, your import statement will be as follows:\n\n```objective-c\n@import mParticle_Apple_SDK;                // Apple recommended syntax, but requires \"Enable Modules (C and Objective-C)\" in pbxproj\n#import <mParticle_Apple_SDK/mParticle.h>   // Works when modules are not enabled\n\n```\n\nOtherwise, for CocoaPods without `use_frameworks!`, you can use either of these statements:\n\n```objective-c\n#import <mParticle-Apple-SDK/mParticle.h>\n#import \"mParticle.h\"\n```\n\nNext, you'll need to start the SDK:\n\n```objective-c\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application\n        didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\n    MParticleOptions *mParticleOptions = [MParticleOptions optionsWithKey:@\"REPLACE ME\"\n                                                                   secret:@\"REPLACE ME\"];\n    \n    //Please see the Identity page for more information on building this object\n    MPIdentityApiRequest *request = [MPIdentityApiRequest requestWithEmptyUser];\n    request.email = @\"email@example.com\";\n    mParticleOptions.identifyRequest = request;\n    mParticleOptions.onIdentifyComplete = ^(MPIdentityApiResult * _Nullable apiResult, NSError * _Nullable error) {\n        NSLog(@\"Identify complete. userId = %@ error = %@\", apiResult.user.userId, error);\n    };\n    \n    [[MParticle sharedInstance] startWithOptions:mParticleOptions];\n    \n    return YES;\n}\n```\n\nPlease see [Identity](http://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/ios/identity/) for more information on supplying an `MPIdentityApiRequest` object during SDK initialization.\n\n\n## Example Project with Sample Code\n\nA sample project is provided with the mParticle Apple SDK. It is a multi-platform video streaming app for both iOS and tvOS.\n\nClone the repository to your local machine\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-apple-sdk.git\n```\n\nIn order to run either the iOS or tvOS examples, first install the mParticle Apple SDK via [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).\n\n1. Change to the `Examples/CocoaPodsExample` directory\n2. Run `pod install`\n3. Open **Example.xcworkspace** in Xcode, select either the **iOS_Example** or **tvOS_Example** scheme, build and run.\n\n\n## Read More\n\nJust by initializing the SDK you'll be set up to track user installs, engagement, and much more. Check out our doc site to learn how to add specific event tracking to your app.\n\n* [SDK Documentation](http://docs.mparticle.com/#mobile-sdk-guide)\n\n\n## Support\n\nQuestions? Have an issue? Read the [docs](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/ios/) or contact our **Customer Success** team at <support@mparticle.com>.\n\n## License\n\nApache 2.0\n"

It is a drop-in replacement that can substantially speed things up.\n\n***Note***: it is only intended for debug builds, to make debugging faster.\n\n### Performance\n\n<img src=\"img/benchmarks.svg\">\n\nFeel free to file an issue if you find that linking is not at least 40% faster for your case (make sure to run it twice in a row to ensure that [caches](#caching) have been generated). Further benchmark details can be found [here](misc/benchmarks.md).\n\n### Is it worth it for my project?\n\nIt all depends on your risk tolerance and how much you value the speedup in incremental build time. When linking takes more than one second, I'd cut that time in half as the estimated time with this new linker. If that difference is compelling to you, then it'd be worth trying out. Personally, I'd use it in projects with an existing link time of even 500ms (but I am an impatient tinkerer).\n\n### Stability\n\n`zld` is forked from the most recently open-sourced version of `ld`. It's used by thousands of developers across many of the largest apps in the world. Without a few optimizations around hashing, it would produce byte-for-byte the same executables as the open-source one. Although it's not ideal to mix compiler and linker toolchain versions, the open-source one is fairly recent. `zld` will continue to be updated with each new version of `ld` as it is released.\n\n### Installation\n\nBelow are the installation methods. Note that, if you someday install a newer version of Xcode and zld doesn't work with it, it may be that your version of zld is now too far behind that of the linker shipped in Xcode. In that case, check back here for the latest zld release to fix the problem.\n\n***Note***: The Xcode app must be installed for zld to work (not just the Xcode command line tools)\n\n#### Pre-built binary\n\nThe pre-built binary for the latest release is [here](https://github.com/michaeleisel/zld/releases/latest).\n\n#### Building from source\n\n- `sudo xcode-select -s <path to Xcode>`\n- Install cmake\n- Checkout the [latest release of zld](https://github.com/michaeleisel/zld/releases/latest) from master\n- Run `make clean && make`\n- See in the output where it built zld (probably `build/Build/Products/Release/zld`).\n\n### Usage\n\n#### If using Xcode:\nGet the path of zld from `which zld`, then add `-fuse-ld=<path to zld> -Wl,-zld_original_ld_path,$(DT_TOOLCHAIN_DIR)/usr/bin/ld` to \"Other Linker Flags\" in the build settings (debug configuration). That `-zld_original_ld_path` provides the path to the linker Xcode would otherwise use, which is important because there are certain known cases (e.g. arm64_32 and Catalyst) where zld knows that it has issues and will silently use that linker instead. Fixing these cases is a work-in-progress (largely blocked by Apple being slow to release source code).\n\n#### If using Bazel:\n\nAdd these to your `.bazelrc` or pass them to your command line.\n\n```\nbuild --linkopt=-fuse-ld=<path to zld>\nbuild --linkopt=-Wl,-zld_original_ld_path,__BAZEL_XCODE_DEVELOPER_DIR__/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/ld\n```\n\nNote that you will need to disable sandbox for this to work now. Additionally, to make the linking actions cacheable, the path to zld must be deterministic (e.g. `/tmp/zld-09ea158`, where `09ea158` is zld version).\n\nAnother option to use `zld` in Bazel is via [rules_apple_linker](https://github.com/keith/rules_apple_linker).\n\n#### If using Rust:\n\nYou can edit `~/.cargo/config` to add a linker flag, e.g.:\n\n```\n[target.x86_64-apple-darwin]\n\nrustflags = [\"-C\", \"link-arg=-fuse-ld=<path to zld>\"]\n```\n\n### Caching\n\nBy default, `zld` stores some metadata in `/tmp/zld-...` to speed things up. This is the first step towards making `zld` a truly incremental linker. Currently, the only things that are stored are object file and library names.\n\n### Why is it faster?\n\nApple's approach is a very reasonable one, using C++ with STL data structures. However, there are a number of ways in which `zld` has sped things up, for instance:\n\n- Using [Swiss Tables](https://abseil.io/blog/20180927-swisstables) instead of STL for hash maps and sets\n- Parallelizing in various places (the parsing of libraries, writing the output file, sorting, etc.)\n- Optimizations around the hashing of strings (caching the hashes, using a better hash function, etc.)\n\n### Other things to speed up linking\n\nWhether you use this project or not, there are a number of things that can speed linking up (again, this is only for debug builds):\n\n- The linker flag `-Wl,-random_uuid`, which disables content hashing based UUID creation and instead uses a random UUID (using `-no_uuid` can decrease performance when lldb is attaching to the binary)\n- Turning off dead stripping (referred to as \"Dead Code Stripping\" in Xcode build settings)\n- For executables and xctest bundles, disable dyld exports trie creation with `-Wl,-exported_symbols_list,/dev/null` (cannot be used by test host apps that provide symbols to xctests)\n- `-Wl,-no_deduplicate`, which disables the deduplication pass. In Xcode, this flag is added by default for Debug builds.\n- `-Wl,-no_compact_unwind`, which disables the creation of compact unwind info. Note that Objective-C and C++ functions that have been linked without their compact unwind info can crash if an exception unwinds into them, rather than continuing the unwind. Swift functions, however, are not affected (even if an Objective-C/C++ exception unwinds into them). So, it's best for pure Swift projects. It can also break crash reporting.\n- If you're not using `zld`, using `-Wl,-force_load` for libraries can sometimes speed things up\n- Linking with dynamic libraries instead of static ones\n\n### Contributing\n\nThe biggest way to contribute to `zld` is to file issues! If you encountered any problems, feel free to file an issue, and you can expect a prompt response.\n\nSpecial thanks to @dmaclach's [ld64](https://github.com/dmaclach/ld64), which helped with building `ld`.\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Apple GPU\n\nThis is a project working on reverse engineering the Apple G13 GPU architecture (as used by the M1), and hacking together documentation, a disassembler, an emulator and an assembler along the way. This is a somewhat messy work in progress, but it reflects the best of my understanding.\n\nDocumentation can be viewed at https://dougallj.github.io/applegpu/docs.html\n\n\n## Disassembler\n\nThis is probably the most useful bit, still an early work in progress:\n\n```\n$ python3 disassemble.py code.bin\n   0: 0501040d00c43200     device_load      2, 0, i32, pair, 4, r0_r1, u2_u3, 0, lsl 1\n   8: 3800                 wait             0\n   a: be890a042c00         convert          u32_to_f, $r2, r0.discard, 1\n  10: be810a242c00         convert          u32_to_f, $r0, r1.discard, 1\n  16: 9a85c4020200         fmul             $r1, r2.discard, 0.5\n  1c: 0a05c282             rcp              r1, r1.discard\n  20: 9a81c0020200         fmul             $r0, r0.discard, 0.5\n  26: 0a01c082             rcp              r0, r0.discard\n  2a: c508803d00803000     uniform_store    2, i16, pair, 0, r1l_r1h, 8\n  32: c500a03d00803000     uniform_store    2, i16, pair, 0, r0l_r0h, 10\n```\n\n## Assembler\n\nUseful for generating tests. Very hacky, and missing a lot of error checking, so check the disassembly output to see if it gave you what you asked for.\n\n```\n$ python3 assemble.py 'fmul $r1, r2.discard, 0.5 ; rcp r1, r1.discard'\n9a85c4020200                     fmul             $r1, r2.discard, 0.5\n0a05c282                         rcp              r1, r1.discard\n```\n\n## Emulator\n\nEmulator is not a standalone tool, nor a final API, and so far has only been used for testing the logic of instructions against hardware. There's no flow control yet, but if you want to use it, it looks something like:\n\n```\ncs = applegpu.CoreState()\n\n# use cs.set_reg32/cs.set_reg16 to initialise core state\n\nremaining = instructions\nwhile remaining:\n\tn = applegpu.opcode_to_number(remaining)\n\tdesc = applegpu.get_instruction_descriptor(n)\n\tdesc.exec(n, cs)\n\tsize = desc.decode_size(n)\n\tremaining = remaining[size:]\n\n# use cs.get_reg32/cs.get_reg16 to dump core state\n```\n\nHowever, it is used in the hardware tests.\n\n## Hardware tests\n\nHardware tests run instructions on the actual GPU (so can only run on Apple Silicon), and emulate them, and compare state afterwards. This is achieved using a modified version of Alyssa Rosenzweig's wrap.dylib from https://github.com/AsahiLinux/gpu\n\nTo build the testbed: `cd hwtestbed && make`\n\nTo run the tests: `python3 hwtest.py`\n\nThis will take ages, but builds a cache in `hwtestbed/cache` allowing future runs to be a bit faster. I generally comment out what I'm not working on. The disk is used extensively to communicate between python and the injected dylib - this could be fixed. It's probably not the worst culprit, but I wouldn't run the tests if you're trying to avoid hammering your disk (https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1361160838854316032)\n\nWith a bit of work it should be possible to test much better and much more quickly (i.e. explicitly test cases that actually matter, rather than iterating through every combination we think might do something that might matter).\n\nHardware testing is great because it's hard to mess up, quick to add new tests, and we have tests. Most other things about it are currently not great. The tests are a bit scattershot - some tests are thorough, but others only test what had to be work to implement other tests. It can be hard to see what's covered, so I've found it useful to experimentally break things to see if they're being covered by the tests or not.\n\nAlso, there's also no cache invalidation, there are hardcode offsets, there's tons of dead code, and I'm generally afraid to modify the code in hwtestbed because any changes to how it configures the GPU might break all the tests, and it'd be painful to rebuild my cache to make sure it's all still working. `main.mm` and `compute.metal` were written with this in mind, and should be flexible enough to allow uniform register tests and device memory tests to be added.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation is generated, partially based on the instruction descriptions in `applegpu.py` using:\n\n```\n$ python3 genhtml.py > docs.html\n```\n\nMost of the text is in `genhtml.py`.\n"

The publication is located at [https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-179/rev-1/draft](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-179/rev-1/draft).  \nPlease send any comments to 800-179comments@nist.gov.\n\n## Settings Spreadsheet\nThe settings spreadsheet contains the information needed to configure a system on a per-setting basis. It includes each setting's identifier, command line instructions, and profile values. For a detailed explanation of the spreadsheet contents, see Appendix A of SP 800-179 Rev. 1.\n\n## Script Overview\nThe samc10_12 shell script performs 2 functions:\n\n  * set configuration items to specified NIST profile values for macOS version 10.12  \n  * read the current system state for settings specified by the NIST profiles\n\nAll configuration settings are grouped into batches. This is done to allow specific portions of the settings to be run easily. Every setting has a unique Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) identifier and its own script function. This is used to track any action performed by a setting throughout the script.\n\nSome settings are user-specific. The script functions for these settings are aggregated in a list where they will be run for a specified user, or all users, as determined by the script options.\n\n\n### Usage\nThe script must be run as root. In order to run the script, the execute bit must be enabled. Enable execution with the following command: `chmod +x samc10_12.sh` After running the script, a system restart is required for some settings to take effect. \n\n| Command                  | Short Description    |\n|:-------------------------|:---------------------|\n| `samc10_12.sh -a`          | Run user-specific settings for all users |\n| `samc10_12.sh -h`          | Display the usage message            |\n| `samc10_12.sh -k`          | Skip time-consuming print/set operations  |\n| `samc10_12.sh -l`          | List the settings |\n| `samc10_12.sh -p`          | Print settings values    |\n| `samc10_12.sh -s ent \\| sslf \\| soho \\| oem` | Apply the chosen profile|\n| `samc10_12.sh -u username` | Run user-specific settings for this user |\n| `samc10_12.sh -v`          | Verbose output           |\n\nThe `-p` and `-s` options provide the core functionality, and the other options modify how these behave. Except when using the `-l` or `-h` options, `-p` or `-s` should always be used.\n\n### Options\n\n| Option | Long Description            |\n|:-------|:----------------------------|\n| `-a`     | Run user-specific settings for all non-system user accounts. If `-a` or `-u` is not specified, the settings are applied to the current user.                                                      |\n| `-h`     | Prints a short help message.                            |\n| `-k`     | Skip settings that take a significant amount of time to run. Update Apple software is the only setting to use this flag. It may take a long time to run, depending on download speed and the size of updates. |                     \n| `-l`     | List the CCE identifiers, function name, and 10.12 testing status for each setting. Does not make changes to the system configuration.                                                     |\n| `-p`     | Prints the current state of the system. Does not make changes to the system configuration.                |\n| `-s`     | Apply the specified security profile. Accepted profiles are `ent` (enterprise/managed), `soho` (Small Office Home Office/standalone), `sslf` (Specialized-Security Limited Functionality), and `oem` (Original Equipment Manufacturer).                                           | \n| `-u`     | Run user-specific settings for the designated user. If `-a` or `-u` is not specified, the settings are applied to the current user. |\n| `-v`     | Output additional settings information. This produces a large quantity of output, which can benefit from saving to a file.                |\n\n\n\n### Examples\n| Terminal Command            | Result         |\n|:--------------------------- |:-------------- |\n| `./samc10_12.sh -vp`            | The script runs in print mode. No changes to the system will be made. Any settings that support the verbose option will print more informative output. User-specific settings will print the values for the current user.             |\n| `./samc10_12.sh -s ent -u dave` | The script will run in set mode for the enterprise profile. All system-wide settings will be applied, and any user-specific settings will be applied to user __dave__.         |\n| `./samc10_12.sh \u2013pak`           | The script will print the state for system-wide settings and user-specific settings will be printed for each non-system user. Time-consuming settings will be skipped.        |\n\n\n#### Run Script to Assess System State for All Users \n\n1.\tDownload the \u201csamc10_12.sh\u201d script. To avoid access permission errors, put the script in a directory accessible to all users, such as the `/Users/Shared` directory.\n2.\tOpen the Terminal program.\n3.\tIn Terminal, navigate to the directory where the script was downloaded using the `cd` command. \n4.\tType `chmod +x samc10_12.sh` and press \"enter\" to enable the execution permssion on the script. Note that if you have already downloaded the script and run this command, it is not necessary to do this again.\n5.\tIf you are not logged into an admin account, type `su USERNAME`, where USERNAME is an administrator account, and press \u201center\u201d. Then type your password when prompted. \n6.\tType `sudo ./samc10_12.sh -pa` and press \"enter\". This will run the script with the `-p` and `-a` options, which prints the system state for all users on the system. \n7.\tType your password when prompted, and the script will begin execution.\n\n#### Run Script to Apply Enterprise Profile for All Users\n\n1.\tDownload the \u201csamc10_12.sh\u201d script. To avoid access permission errors, put the script in a directory accessible to all users, such as the `/Users/Shared` directory.\n2.\tOpen the Terminal program.\n3.\tIn Terminal, navigate to the directory where the script was downloaded using the `cd` command. \n4.\tType `chmod +x samc10_12.sh` and press \"enter\" to enable the execution permssion on the script. Note that if you have already downloaded the script and run this command, it is not necessary to do this again.\n5.\tIf you are not logged into an admin account, type `su USERNAME`, where USERNAME is an administrator account, and press \u201center\u201d. Then type your password when prompted.\n6.\tType `sudo ./samc10_12.sh -s ent -a` and press \"enter\". This will run the script with the `-s` and `-a` options, which applies the settings using the enterprise profile for all users on the system. \n7.\tType your password when prompted, and the script will begin execution.\n\n\n## Password Policy: Formatted `.plist`\nThe `samc10_12_pwpolicy.plist` file contains the password policies generated by the script and recommended by the publication. \n\n## FAQ\n**What version of macOS is supported by this script?**  \nOnly macOS 10.12 (Sierra) is supported.\n\n**How do I enable SSH on a host system after applying a configuration profile?**  \nThe configuration uses multiple methods to prevent SSH access. Using an administrative account, do the following on the host system to re-enable remote login:\n\n1. Open System Preferences -> Sharing. Enable \"Remote Login\", and add the desired users to the \"Allowed Access for\" box.\n2. In System Preferences -> Security & Privacy, open the \"Firewall\" tab. Open \"Firewall Options\" and uncheck \"Block all incoming connections\". This will allow SSH through the Application Firewall.\n3. Open Terminal and run the command `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config` to edit the config file. Comment out or delete the `Deny Users *` line at the bottom. This line should be `#DenyUsers *` if it is commented out. Save and close the file.\n4. Again in Terminal, run the command `sudo nano /etc/pf.anchors/sam_pf_anchors` to edit pf firewall rules. Comment out the line `block in proto { tcp udp } to any port 22` so it becomes `#block in proto { tcp udp } to any port 22`. Save and close the file.\n5. Restart the system.\n\n**How do I resync the keychain login password with the user login password?**  \nA Keychain sync issue can occur after an account password expires and is reset, and can be fixed with one of the following:\n\n1st Solution:  \n\n1. In the Keychain Access program, make sure the login keychain is selected, and click the lock at the top left.\n2. Unlock the keychain, and enter the updated password.\n3. A window should appear asking to enter the current password and to create a new password/verify new password.\n4. Enter the old password in the first field, and your updated password in the new password/verify password fields.\n\n\n2nd Solution:  \n\n1. Open Keychain Access, and go to \u201cPreferences\".\n2. Under the \"First Aid\" tab, check off \"Synchronize login keychain password with account\u201d\n3. Close the Preferences and open \u201cKeychain First Aid\u201d under the Keychain Access menu.\n4. Click the \u201cRepair\u201d option on the right, and enter your updated password.\n"

This is a demo to demonstrate what is possible to solve.\n<br>\nI used the Playground on macOS. \n<br>\nI believe in open source I think to push humanity forward you have to open source all the things \\o/\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n![](http://imgur.com/0urwCTN.png)\n<br>\n<br>\n![](http://i.imgur.com/qhweGhT.gif)\n<br>\n<br>\nYou can watch the YouTube Video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9pplv7cZ7k)\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## Abstract Overview\n\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/qVKMBym.png\" width=\"350\">\n\n### This is how the encoded image look's like. \n\n![](http://imgur.com/3iRGrFv.png)\n\n### Neural Network Story\n\nI used this challenge to learn more about neural networks and machine learning.\nA neural network consists of layers, and each layer has neurons. My network has three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer.\n<br><br>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/DZh33WL.png\" width=\"250\">\n<br><br>\nThe input to my network has 64 binary numbers. These inputs are connected to the neurons in the hidden layer. The hidden layer performs some computation and passes the result to the output layer neuron out. This also performs a computation and then outputs a 0 or a 1. The input layer doesn\u2019t actually do anything, they are just placeholders for the input value. Only the neurons in the hidden layer and the output layer perform computations.  The neurons from the input layer are connected to   the neurons in the hidden layer. Likewise, both neurons from the hidden layer are connected to the output layer. These kinds of layers are called fully-connected because every neuron is connected to every neuron in the next layer. Each connection between two neurons has a weight, which is just a number. These weights form the brain of my network. For the activation function in my network, I use the sigmoid function. ![](http://i.imgur.com/Xrhx1wl.png)<br><br>\nSigmoid is a mathematical function. The sigmoid takes in some number x and converts it into a value between 0 and 1. That is ideal for my purposes, since I am dealing with binary numbers.\nThis will turn a linear equation into something that is non-linear. This is important because without this, the network wouldn\u2019t be able to learn any interesting things. \n\nI have already mentioned that the input to this network are 64 binary numbers. I resize the drawn image to 8x8 pixels which makes together 64 pixels. I go through the image and check each pixel if the pixel has a pink color I add a 1 to my array else I add a 0. At the end I will have 64 binary numbers which I can add to my input layer. \n\nMy main goal was to make neural network and machine learning more accessible and fun. As well to learn more about the powerful features of playgrounds and neural networks. \n\n### Author\n\n  [@reffas_bilal](https://twitter.com/Reffas_Bilal)\n  \n  [bilalreffas@googlemail.com]()\n  \n\n### Credits\n  [Vincent Esche](https://twitter.com/regexident)\n  \n  [Per Harald Borgen](https://twitter.com/perborgen)\n  \n  [Matthijs Hollemans](https://twitter.com/mhollemans)\n\n### Thank you \ud83c\udf89\n\n  If you like this project please leave a star \ud83c\udf1f here on Github and share it.\n  \n### Luubra\n\n  I'm working with [@leoMehlig ](https://twitter.com/leoMehlig) on Luubra.

Choose 'Add to iCloud Music Library'\n* Once the songs have been registered, right click again and 'Remove download', you can now stream or download the full song using your Apple Music subscription.\n\nDevelopment\n----\nTo build the project you have to create a file called `Applefy/appkey.c`. The content must be set to the C-Code created under [Spotify Developer : My application keys](https://devaccount.spotify.com/my-account/keys/).\n\nLimitations\n----\nSome of the music files will not be found by iTunes and so instead of matching the file it will just upload the 5 second silent clip. This is because the song name from Spotify does not match the iTunes name. Easiest way to fix this is just remove the song and add it manually, it doesn't happen very often.\n\n\nDisclaimer\n---\n\nThis application is in no way affiliated with, authorized, maintained, sponsored or endorsed by either Apple Inc. or Spotify. \n\niTunes\u00ae is the registered trademark of Apple Inc.  \nSpotify is the registered trademark of the Spotify Group\n"

  "readme_contents": "# HelloSilicon\n\nAn introduction to assembly on Apple Silicon Macs.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn this repository, I will code along with the book [Programming with 64-Bit ARM Assembly Language](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-100586055-13091548?url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fbook%2F10.1007%2F978-1-4842-5881-1), adjusting all sample code for Apple's ARM64 line of computers. While Apple's marketing material seems to avoid a name for the platform and talks only about the M1 processor, the developer documentation uses the term \"Apple Silicon\". I will use this term in the following.\n\nThe original sourcecode can be found [here](https://github.com/Apress/programming-with-64-bit-ARM-assembly-language).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nWhile I pretty much assume that people who made it here meet most if not all required prerequisites, it doesn't hurt to list them.\n\n* You need [Xcode 12.2](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or later, and to make things easier, the command line tools should be installed. This ensures that the tools are found in default locations (namely `/usr/bin`). If you are not sure that the tools are installed, check _Preferences \u2192 Locations_ in Xcode or run `xcode-select --install`.\n\n* All application samples also require [macOS Big Sur](https://developer.apple.com/macos/), [iOS 14](https://developer.apple.com/ios/) or their respective watchOS or tvOS equivalents. Especially for the later three systems it is not a necessity per-se (neither is Xcode 12.2), but it makes things a lot simpler.\n\n* Finally, while all samples can be adjusted to work on the iPhone and all other of Apple's ARM64 devices, for best results you should have access to an [Apple Silicon Mac](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/introducing-the-next-generation-of-mac/), formerly known as the MWMNSA, the _Machine We Must Not Speak About_.\n\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nI would like to thank [@claui](https://github.com/claui), [@jannau](https://github.com/jannau), [@jrosengarden](https://github.com/jrosengarden), [@m-schmidt](https://github.com/m-schmidt), [@saagarjha](https://github.com/saagarjha), and [@zhuowei](https://github.com/zhuoweir)! They helped me when I hit a wall, or asked questions that let me improve the content.\n\n## Changes To The Book\n\nWith the exception of the existing iOS samples, the book is based on the Linux operating system. Apple's operating systems (macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS) are actually just flavors of the [Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)) operating system, so they share a set of common core components.\n\nLinux and Darwin, which were both inspired by [AT&T Unix System V](http://www.unix.org/what_is_unix/history_timeline.html), are significantly different at the level we are looking at. For the listings in the book, this mostly concerns system calls (i.e. when we want the Kernel to do someting for us), and the way Darwin accesses memory.\n\nThis file is organized so that you can read the book, and read about the differences for Apple Silicon side by side. The headlines in this document follow those in the book.\n\n## Chapter 1: Getting Started\n\n### Computers and Numbers\n\nThe default Calculator.app on macOS has a \"Programmer Mode\", too. You enable it with _View \u2192 Programmer_ (\u23183).\n\n### CPU Registers\n\nApple has made certain platform specific choices for the registers:\n\n* Apple reserves **X18** for its own use. Do not use this register.\n* The frame pointer register (**FP**, **X29**) must always address a valid frame record.\n\n### About the GCC Assembler\n\nThe book uses Linux GNU tools, such as the GNU `as` assembler. While there is an `as` command on macOS, it will invoke the integrated [LLVM Clang](https://clang.llvm.org) assembler by default. And even if there is the `-Q` option to use the GNU based assembler, this was only ever an option for x86_64 \u2014 and is already deprecated as of this writing.\n```\n% as -Q -arch arm64\n/usr/bin/as: can't specifiy -Q with -arch arm64\n```\nThus, the GNU assembler syntax is not an option, and the code will have to be adjusted for the Clang assembler syntax.\n\nLikewise, while there is a `gcc` command on macOS, this simply calls the Clang C-compiler. For transparancy, all calls to `gcc` will be replaced with `clang`.\n\n```\n% gcc --version\nConfigured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/c++/4.2.1\nApple clang version 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.27)\nTarget: arm64-apple-darwin20.1.0\nThread model: posix\nInstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin\n```\n\n### Hello World, Listing 1-1\n\nIf you are reading this, I assume you already knew that the macOS Terminal can be found in _Applications \u2192 Utilities \u2192 Terminal.app_. But if you didn't I feel honored to tell you and I wish you lots of fun on this journey! Don't be afraid to ask questions.\n\nTo make \"Hello World\" run on Apple Silicon, first the changes from page 78 (Chapter 3) have to be applied to account for the differences between Darwin and the Linux kernel.\nTo silence the warning, I insert `.align 4` (or `.p2align 2`), because Darwin likes things to be aligned on even boundaries. The books mentions this in Aligning Data in Chapter 5, page 114.\n\nTo make the linker work, a little more is needed, most of it should look familiar to Mac/iOS developers. These changes need to be applied to the `makefile` and to the `build` file. The complete call to the linker looks like this:\n\n```\nld -o HelloWorld HelloWorld.o \\\n\t-lSystem \\\n\t-syslibroot `xcrun -sdk macosx --show-sdk-path` \\\n\t-e _start \\\n\t-arch arm64\n```\n\nWe know the `-o` switch, let's examine the others:\n\n\n* `-lSystem` tells the linker to link our executable with `libSystem.dylib`. We do that to add the `LC_MAIN` load command to the executable. Generally, Darwin does not support [statically linked executables](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1118/_index.html). It is [possible](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32453849/minimal-mach-o-64-binary/32659692#32659692), if not especially elegant to create executables without using `libSystem.dylib`. I will go deeper into that topic when time permits. For people who read _Mac OS X Internals_ I will just add that this replaced `LC_UNIXTHREAD` as of MacOS X 10.7.\n* `-sysroot`: In order to find `libSystem.dylib`, it is mandatory to tell our linker where to find it. It seems this was not necessary on macOS 10.15 because _\"New in macOS Big Sur 11 beta, the system ships with a built-in dynamic linker cache of all system-provided libraries. As part of this change, copies of dynamic libraries are no longer present on the filesystem.\"_. We use `xcrun -sdk macosx --show-sdk-path` to dynamically use the currently active version of Xcode.\n* `-e _start`: Darwin expects an entrypoint `_main`. In order to keep the sample both as close as possible to the book, and to allow it's use within the C-Sample from _Chapter 3_, I opted to keep `_start` and tell the linker that this is the entry point we want to use\n* `-arch arm64` for good measure, let's throw in the option to cross-compile this from an Intel Mac. You can leave this off when running on Apple Silicon.\n\n## Chapter 2: Loading and Adding\n\nThe changes from [Chapter 1](https://github.com/below/HelloSilicon#chapter-1) (makefile, alignment, system calls) have to be applied.\n\n### Register and Shift\n\nThe Clang assembler does not understand `MOV X1, X2, LSL #1`, instead `LSL X1, X2, #1` (etc) is used. After all, both are just aliasses for the instruction `ORR X1, XZR, X2, LSL #1`.\n\n### Register and Extension\n\nClang requires the source register to be 32-Bit. This makes sense because with these extensions, the upper 32 Bit of a 64-Bit register will never be touched:\n```\nADD X2, X1, W0, SXTB\n```\nThe GNU Assembler seems to ignore this and allows you to specifiy a 64-Bit source register.\n\n## Chapter 3: Tooling Up\n\n### Beginning GDB\n\nOn macOS, `gdb` has been replaced with the [LLDB Debugger](https://lldb.llvm.org) `lldb` of the LLVM project. The syntax is not always the same as for gdb, so I will note the differences here.\n\nTo start debugging our **movexamps** program, enter the command\n\n```\nlldb movexamps\n```\n\nThis yields the abbreviated output:\n\n```\n(lldb) target create \"movexamps\"\nCurrent executable set to 'movexamps' (arm64).\n(lldb)\n```\n\nCommands like `run` or `list` work just the same, and there is a nice [GDB to LLDB command map](https://lldb.llvm.org/use/map.html).\n\nTo disassemble our program, a slightly different syntax is used for lldb:\n\n```\ndisassemble --name start\n```\n\nNote that because we are linking a dynamic executable, the listing will be long and include other `start` functions. Our code will be listed under the line ``movexamps`start``.\n\nLikewise, lldb wants the breakpoint name without the underscore: `b start`\n\nTo get the registers on lldb, we use **register read** (or **re r**). Without arguments, this command will print all registers, or you can specify just the registers you would like to see, like `re r SP X0 X1`.\n\nWe can see all the breakpoints with **breakpoint list** (or **br l**). We can delete a breakpoint with **breakpoint delete** (or **br de**) specifying the breakpoint number to delete.\n\n**lldb** has even more powerful mechanisms to display memory. The main command is **memory read** (or **m read**). For starters, these are the parameters used by the book:\n\n```\nmemory read -fx -c4 -s4 $address\n```\n\nwhere\n* **-f** is the display format\n* **-s** size of the data\n* **-c** count\n\n### Listing 3-1\n\nAs an exercise, I have added code to find the default Xcode toolchain on macOS. In the book they are using this to later switch from a Linux to an Android toolchain. This process is much different for macOS and iOS: It does not usually involve a different toolchain, but instead a different Software Development Kit (SDK). You can see this in [Listing 1-1](https://github.com/below/HelloSilicon#listing-1-1) where `-sysroot` is set.\n\nThat said, while it is possible to build an iOS executable with the command line it is not a trivial process. So for building apps I will stick to Xcode.\n\n### Listing 3-7\n\nAs [Chapter 10](https://github.com/below/HelloSilicon#chapter-10) focusses on building an app that will run on iOS, I have chosen to simply create a Command Line Tool here which is now using the same `HelloWorld.s` file.\n\n## Chapter 4: Controlling Programm Flow\n\nBesides the common changes, we face a new issue which is described in the book in Chapter 5: Darwin does not like `LDR X1, =symbol`, it will produce the error `ld: Absolute addressing not allowed in arm64 code`. If we use `ASR X1, symbol`, as suggested in Chapter 3 of the book, our data has to be in the read-only `.text` section. In this sample however, we want writable data.\n\nThe [Apple Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachOTopics/1-Articles/x86_64_code.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005044-SW1) tells us that on Darwin:\n> All large or possibly nonlocal data is accessed indirectly through a global offset table (GOT) entry. The GOT entry is accessed directly using RIP-relative addressing.\n\nAnd by default, on Darwin all data contained in the `.data` section, where data is writeable, is \"possibly nonlocal\".\n\nThe full answer can be found [here](https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/a/15324):\n> The `ADRP` instruction loads the address of the 4KB page anywhere in the +/-4GB (33 bits) range of the current instruction (which takes 21 high bits of the offset). This is denoted by the `@PAGE` operator. then, we can either use `LDR` or `STR` to read or write any address inside that page or `ADD` to to calculate the final address using the remaining 12 bits of the offset (denoted by `@PAGEOFF`).\n\nSo this:\n\n```\n\tLDR\tX1, =outstr // address of output string\n```\n\nbecomes this:\n\n```\n\tADRP\tX1, outstr@PAGE\t// address of output string 4k page\n\tADD\tX1, X1, outstr@PAGEOFF // offset to outstr within the page\n```\n\n### Excersises\n\nI was asked how to read the command line, and I gladly [answered](https://github.com/below/HelloSilicon/issues/22#issuecomment-682205151) the question.\n\nSample code can be found in Chapter 4 in the file [`case.s`](Chapter%2004/case.s).\n\n## Chapter 5: Thanks for the Memories\n\nThe important differences in memory addressing for Darwin were already addresed above.\n\n### Listing 5-1\nThe `quad`, `octa` and `fill` keywords must be in lowercase for the llvm assembler. (See bottom of this file)\n\n### Listing 5-10\n\nChanges like in Chapter 4.\n\n## Chapter 6: Functions and the Stack\n\nAs we learned in Chapter 5, all assembler directives (like `.equ`) must be in lowercase.\n\n## Chapter 7: Linux Operating System Services\n`asm/unistd.h` does not exist in the Apple SDKs, instead `sys/syscalls.h` can be used.\n\nIt is also important to notice that while the calls and definitions look similar, Linux and Darwin are not the same: `AT_FDCWD` is -100 on Linux, but must be -2 on Darwin.\n\nUnlike Linux, errors are signified by setting the carry flag, and the error codes are non-negative. We therefore `MOV` the result into the required register instead of `ADDS` (we don't need to check for negative numbers, and need to preserve the condition flags) and B.CC to the success path.\n\n## Chapter 8: Programming GPIO Pins\n\nThis chapter is specifically for the Raspberry Pi 4, so there is nothing to do here.\n\n## Chapter 9: Interacting with C and Python\n\nFor transparency reasons, I replaced `gcc` with `clang`.\n\n### Listing 9-1\nApart from the usual changes, Apple diverges from the ARM64 standard ABI (i.e. the convention how functions are called) for variadic functions. Variadic functions are functions which take a variable number of arguments, and `printf` is one of them. Where Linux will accept arguments passed in the registers we must pass them on the stack for Darwin.\n\n```\nstr     X1, [SP, #-32]! // Move the stack pointer four doublewords (32 bytes) down and push X1 onto the stack\nstr     X2, [SP, #8]    // Push X2 to one doubleword above the current stack pointer\nstr     X3, [SP, #16]   // Push X3 to two doublewords above the current stack pointer\nadrp    X0, ptfStr@PAGE // printf format str\nadd     X0, X0, ptfStr@PAGEOFF  // add offset for format str\nbl      _printf // call printf\nadd     SP, SP, #32 // Clean up stack\n```\n\nSo first, we are growing the stack downwards 32 bytes to make room for three 64-Bit values. We are creating space for a fourth value for padding because, as pointed out on page 137 in the book, ARM hardware requires the stack pointer to always be 16-byte aligned.\n\nIn the same command, **X1** is stored at the new location of the stack pointer.\n\nNow, we fill the rest of the space that was just created by storing **X2** in a location eight bytes above, and **X3** 16 bytes above the stack pointer. Note that the **str** commands for **X2** and **X3** do not move **SP**.\n\nWe could fill the stack in different ways; what is important that the `printf` function expects the parameters as doubleword values in order, upwards from the current stackpointer. So in the case of the `debug.s` file, it expects the parameter for the `%c` to be at the location of **SP**, the parameter for `%32ld` at one doubleword above this, and finally the parameter for `%016lx` two doublewords, 16 bytes, above the current stack pointer.\n\nWhat we have effectively done is [allocating memory on the stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-based_memory_allocation). As we, the caller, \"own\" that memory we need to release it after the function branch, in this case simply by shrinking the stack (upwards) by the 32 bytes we allocated. The instruction `add SP, SP, #32` will do that.\n\n### Listing 9-5\n`mytoupper` was prefixed with `_` as this is necessary for C on Darwin to find it.\n\n### Listing 9-6\n\nNo change was required.\n\n### Listing 9-7\nInstead of a shared `.so` ELF library, a dynamic Mach-O libary is created. Further information can be found here: [Creating Dynamic Libraries](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/DynamicLibraries/100-Articles/CreatingDynamicLibraries.html)\n\n### Listing 9-8\nIn inline-assembly, which we are using here, The `cont` label must be declared as a local label by prefixing it with `L`. While this was not necessary in pure assembly, like in Chapter 5, the llvm C-Frontend will automatically add the directive [`.subsections_via_symbols`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Reference/Assembler/040-Assembler_Directives/asm_directives.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000823-SW13) to the code:\n\n> Funny Darwin hack: This flag tells the linker that no global symbols contain code that falls through to other global symbols (e.g. the obvious implementation of multiple entry points).  If this doesn't occur, the linker can safely perform dead code stripping. Since LLVM never generates code that does this, it is always safe to set.\n(From [llvm source code](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/89b57061f7b769e9ea9bf6ed686e284f3e55affe/llvm/lib/Target/AArch64/AArch64AsmPrinter.cpp#L568))\n\nWhile we are using the LLVM toolchain, in assembly \u2014 including inline-assembly \u2014 all safety checks are off so we must take extra precautions and specifically declare the forward label local.\n\nAlso, the size of one variable had to be changed from int to long to make the compiler complete happy and remove all warnings\n\n### Calling Assembly from Python\n\n### Listing 9-9\n\nWhile the `uppertst5.py` file only needed a minimal change, calling the code is a little more challenging. On Apple Silicon Macs, Python is a Mach-O universal binary with two architectures, x86\\_64 and arm64e:\n\n```\n% lipo -info /usr/bin/python3 \nArchitectures in the fat file: /usr/bin/python3 are: x86_64 arm64e\n```\n\nNotably absent is the arm64 architecture we were building for up to this point. This makes our dylib unusable with Python.\n\narm64e is the [Armv-8 architecture](https://community.arm.com/developer/ip-products/processors/b/processors-ip-blog/posts/armv8-a-architecture-2016-additions), which Apple is using since the A12 chip. If you want to address devices prior to the A12, you must stick to arm64. The first Macs to use ARM64 run on the M1 CPU based on the A14 architecture, thus Apple decided to take advangage of the new features.\n\nSo, what to do? We could compile everything as arm64e, but that would make the library useless on devices like the iPhone X or older, and we would like to support them, too.\n\nAbove, you read something about a _universal binary_. For a very long time, the Mach-O executable format was supporting several processor architectures in a single file. This includes, but is not limited to, Motorola 68k (on NeXT computers), PowerPC, Intel x86, as well ARM code, each with their 32 and 64 bit variantes where applicable. In this case, I am building a universal dynamic library which includes both arm64 and arm64e code. More information can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/building_a_universal_macos_binary).\n\nWhile most of the Python IDEs that work for Linux are also avilable for macOS, as of this writing, the only Python IDEs which itself runs as arm64 \u2014\u00a0and thus will load arm64 libraries \u2014 is Python.org [IDLE](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/), version 3.10 or newer. \n\n![Figure 9-1. . Our Python program running in the IDLE IDE](images/Figure_9-1.png?raw=true \"Our Python program running in the IDLE IDE\")\n\n***Figure 9-1.*** *Our Python program running in the IDLE IDE*\n\nAlternatively, you can use the command line to test the program. (As of macOS 12.3, Apple [removed Python 2](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-12_3-release-notes) and developers should use Python 3)\n \n```\n% python3 uppertst5.py \nb'This is a test!'\nb'THIS IS A TEST!'\n16\n```\n\nA final note: While the Apple python3 binary is arm64e, the Python Framework used by IDLE is arm64. The fact that the library built in this chapter is a universal binary containing both architectures allows it to be used in either environment.\n\n\n## Chapter 10: Interfacing with Kotlin and Swift\n\nNo changes in the core code were required, but instead of just an iOS app I created a SwiftUI app that will work on macOS, iOS, watchOS (Series 4 and later), and tvOS.\n\n## Chapter 11: Multiply, Divide, and Accumulate\n\nAt this point, the changes should be self-explainatory. The usual makefile adjustments, `.align 4`, address mode changes, and `_printf` adjustments.\n\n## Chapter 12: Floating-Point Operations\n\nLike in Chapter 11, all the chages have been introduced already. Nothing new here.\n\n## Chapter 13: Neon Coprocessor\n\nOnce again, the Clang assembler wants a slightly different syntax: Where gcc accepts\n\n```\nMUL V6.4H, V0.4H, V3.4H[0]\n```\n\nthe Clang assembler expects\n\n```\nMUL.4H V6, V0, V3[0]\n```\n\nAll other changes to the code should be trivial at this point.\n\n## Chapter 14: Optimizing Code\n\nNo unusal changes here.\n\n## Chapter 15: Reading and Understanding Code\n\n### Copying a Page of Memory\n\nSome place to start reading ARM64 code in the Darwin Kernel can be found in [bcopy.s](https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/blob/master/osfmk/arm64/bcopy.s). There is a lot more in that directory and the repository in general.\n\n### Code Created by GCC\n\nNo changes were required. The \"tiny\" code model is not supported for Mach-O excecutables:\n\n```\n% clang -O3 -mcmodel=tiny -o upper upper.c\nfatal error: error in backend: tiny code model is only supported on ELF\n```\n\n## Chapter 16: Hacking Code\n\nAll that can be said is that clang automatically enables position-independent executables, and the option `-no-pie` does not work. Therefore, the exploit shown in the `upper.s` file can not be reproduced.\n\n## Additional references\n\n* [Writing ARM64 Code for Apple Platforms](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/writing_arm64_code_for_apple_platforms), documentation how Apple platforms diverge from the standard 64-bit ARM architecture\n* [Mach-O Programming Topics](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachOTopics/0-Introduction/introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001827-SW1), an excellent introduction to the Mach-O executable format and how it differs from ELF.

As a result, there is an Apple TV in every single room for the students to quickly present whatever is on their screen, and the teachers can show their presentations with their assigned Macbooks.\n\nI am one of two people at this school who use Linux (Ubuntu) and who bring their laptops every day. I use mine for school work fairly often, as I understand how much I can do in Linux and not iOS. But whenever some task comes up where I'd need to airplay my work to an Apple TV, I'm being restrained to my iPad.\n\nWhat this aims to be:\n---\nThis application is designed to sit in your System Tray just like in OSX, with a drop down list of available Airplay Recievers, and allow you to:\n- Stream your desktop  \n- Send a photo/picture  \n- Play a video  \n- Stream Music  \nAnd whatever else the users and developers of this project wish it to be.\n\nWant to help?\n---\nI'm always looking for contributors, if you can help with any of these I'd love to work with you.  \n * Python network discovery protocols (for finding listings of devices)\n * Airplay/Media protocols\n * Python Qt (thinking about things like screen capture)\n * And developers to help make this work for non-Ubuntu OSs.\n"

  "readme_contents": "LinApple\n========\n\nLinApple is an emulator for Apple ][, Apple ][+, Apple //e, and\nEnhanced Apple //e computers.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nLinApple started as a fork of [AppleWin], ported to run on Linux. The\nsource code was downloaded from [SourceForge] and uploaded to Github\nby [maxolasersquad]. As the SourceForge version lay abandoned several\nusers forked the maxolasersquad repository and added several features.\nWork was done to bring these back into maxolasersquad repository. This\nrepository was eventually moved under the [linappleii] namespace where\ndevelopment currently resides.\n\n[AppleWin]: https://github.com/AppleWin/AppleWin\n[SourceForge]: http://linapple.sourceforge.net/\n[maxolasersquad]: https://github.com/maxolasersquad\n[linappleii]: https://github.com/linappleii\n\n\nCommand Line Switches\n---------------------\n\n* `-h|--help`: Print command-line options and exit.\n* `--conf path/to/file.conf`: Use only the specified configuration file.\n  (The standard configuration file search is not done.)\n* `-1|--d1 path/to/image1.dsk`: Specifies a disk image to load into FDD1 (drive 0)\n* `-2|--d2 path/to/image2.dsk`: Specifies a disk image to load into FDD1 (drive 1)\n* `-b|--autoboot`: Boots the system automatically, rather than displaying the splash screen\n* `-f`: Specifies that the emulator should run in fullscreen mode\n* `-l`: Logs output to a file called AppleWin.log (untested)\n* `--benchmark`: Specifies that benchmark should be loaded (untested)\n\n_Note: some command-line options have not been fully tested._\n\n### Command-line Examples\n\nTo have LinApple start in fullscreen mode and automatically boot the\ndisk `example.dsk`, you can open a shell and run:\n\n    $ linapple --d1 example.dsk -f --autoboot\n\nThis command could also be placed in a shell script, which could be\nstarted from an icon or menu on the desktop.\n\n\nUsing LinApple\n--------------\n\nClicking in the LinApple window will capture the mouse.

(This is a bug in SDL 1.2.)\n\nWhen you first start the emulator, press the F3 key and select a disk\nimage file. Press Ctrl+F2 to restart the emulator with the disk\n\"inserted\" if the application doesn't automatically load.\n\nMany disk images will boot straight into the application. Some disk\nimages only have files and you must find the correct application to\nrun. In this case you will need to execute BASIC commands to list the\nfiles on the disk and run programs.\n\n### Apple II Commands\n\nThis is a brief guide to get you started. For more information see\n[_Apple II: The DOS Manual_][dos3.3] (for DOS 3.3) and the [_ProDOS 8\nTechnical Reference Manual_][prodos].\n\n- `CATALOG`: List the files on a disk. The first column in the list\n  identifies the file type: A for Applesoft BASIC, B for binary. I for\n  Integer BASIC. T for text.\n- `RUN file`: Load and run an Applesoft or Integer BASIC file.\n- `BRUN file`: Load and run a binary file. (Not all binary files can\n  be run.)\n- `EXEC file`: Read commands from a text file and execute them as if\n  they were typed at the keyboard.\n- `LOAD file`: Load an Applesoft or Integer BASIC file into memory.\n- `LIST`: List the current program in memory.\n\n[prodos]: http://www.easy68k.com/paulrsm/6502/PDOS8TRM.HTM\n[dos3.3]: https://archive.org/details/a2_the_DOS_Manual/page/n2/mode/1up\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nLinApple has several configuration options. Most values are loaded\nfrom [INI files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) and\n`linapple.conf.sample` has all possible configuration options along\nwith documentation on each. There are also command-line switches and\nenvironment variables that change the behavior of LinApple.\n\n### Load Order of Configuration Files\n\n1. Default values are initially set by the program.\n2. If the command-line switch `--conf` is used, values are read from\n   the specified file.\n3. Otherwise, values are:\n   1. read from the system-wide configuration files.\n      * These are found in the `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` path. On Linux, the\n        file is typically found at `/etc/xdg/linapple/linapple.conf`.\n   2. read from user-specific configuration files.\n      * These are found in the `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` path. On Linux, the\n        file is typically found at `~/.config/linapple/linapple.conf`.\n\n### Environment Variables\n\nLinApple partially conforms to the [XDG Base Directory Specification][xdg].\n\n`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` specifies the location of _\"a single base directory\nrelative to which user-specific configuration files should be\nwritten\"_. Defaults to `$HOME/.config`.\n\n`XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` specifies the location of _\"a set of preference\nordered base directories relative to which configuration files should\nbe searched\"_. Each directory is separated by a colon (`:`). Defaults\nto `/etc/xdg`.\n\n[xdg]: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html\n"

It can run the Apple 1 WozMon and Integer Basic via the serial or VGA 640x480 video with PS/2 keyboard standalone. This makes this a very compact little set up. So far fully tested and supported boards are:\n- [iCE40HX8K-B-EVN breakout](http://www.latticesemi.com/Products/DevelopmentBoardsAndKits/iCE40HX8KBreakoutBoard.aspx)\n- [Terasic DE0](http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&No=364)\n- [Digilent Spartan-3E Starter Board](https://store.digilentinc.com/spartan-3e-starter-board-limited-time/)\n\nContributor supported boards (YMMV):\n- [Blackice II](https://www.tindie.com/products/Folknology/blackice-ii/)\n- [icoBoard](http://icoboard.org/)\n- [Olimex iCE40HX8K with ICE40-IO](https://www.olimex.com/Products/FPGA/iCE40/iCE40HX8K-EVB/open-source-hardware)\n- [TinyFPGA B2](http://tinyfpga.com/)\n- [Upduino](http://gnarlygrey.atspace.cc/development-platform.html)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"media/apple-one.png\" alt=\"Apple One Running\">\n</p>\n\nThis project borrows heavily from the *awesome* work of Andrew Holme and his [\"Pool\"](http://www.aholme.co.uk/6502/Main.htm) project and [Arlet Otten's](https://github.com/Arlet/verilog-6502) tiny 6502 core. Also many special thanks to [\"sbprojects.com\"](https://www.sbprojects.com/projects/apple1/index.php) for the wealth of information I gleaned from there.\n\n## Memory Map\n \nThe memory map is currently set up to have:\n\n Start | End | Description\n ----- | --- | -----------\n 0x0000 | 0x1FFF | 8KB of block RAM for system\n 0xE000 | 0xEFFF | 4KB of block RAM for basic ROM\n 0xFF00 | 0xFFFF | 256B of block RAM for WozMon ROM\n\nYou can swap out the Basic ROM to get more RAM if you need the space, this can be achieved easily with only minor modifications to the top file.\n \n## Building\n\nEach supported board has a directory in `boards`. This directory has a structure where each board can have multiple build environments (eg. yosys, icecube2, quartus etc).\n\nEach board has specific instructions that will explain further the requirements of each board and how to build for it, but basically all should support the following.\n\nTo build for your board you just need to open the project or use the `Makefile` that's compatible with your board.\n\neg.\n```\n$ cd boards/ice40hx8k-b-evn/yosys/\n$ make\n```\n\n### Board READMEs\n- [iCE40HX8K-B-EVN breakout](boards/ice40hx8k-b-evn/README.md)\n- [Terasic DE0](boards/terasic_de0/README.md)\n- [Digilent Spartan-3E Starter Board](boards/spartan3e_starterkit/README.md)\n- [Blackice II](boards/blackice2/README.md)\n- [Olimex iCE40HX8K with ICE40-IO](boards/olimex_ice40hx8k_evb_ice40-io/README.md)\n- [TinyFPGA B2](boards/tinyfpga_b2/README.md)\n- [Upduino](boards/upduino/README.md)\n\n## The BACKSPACE key and how to delete typos\n\nThe Apple 1 didn't have a typical \"backspace\" key as we are use to today, due to the way the video display worked it couldn't move the cursor backward to erase characters. So instead it used a \"rubout\" character, which is the underscore character (_). This character signifies that the input buffer has been moved backwards one character (eg. `PRN_INT` would be received by the Apple 1 as `PRINT`).\n\nIt takes a little getting used to but you'll soon get the hang of it.\n\n## The Apple 1 only understands UPPERCASE characters\n\nIf you're using the PS/2 input you don't need to be worried about this, as we automatically UPPERCASE all typed characters so WozMon can understand what you are typing.\n\nHowever if you are using the UART and a serial terminal you will need to remember to turn on your CAPSLOCK, otherwise nothing will respond as you might expect.\n\n## Serial Setup\n \nDepending on the board you can use serial to communicate with the Apple 1, some boards require a toggle to be set to select between PS/2 input and UART input. The UART by default will be set to 115200 (8/N/1).\n \nA very basic hardware flow control is implemented. You should turn on CTS support as this will allow you to cut and paste code into the Woz Mon without the Apple 1 missing any bytes.\n\n \n## VGA / PS/2 Setup\n \nMost boards support PS/2 input and VGA output. This is the most support method, however all output is replicated to the UART (if available) and the PS/2 keyboard input can be replaced with the UART out if the \"toggle\" mode buttons is selected.\n\nUnlike the original Apple 1 this implementation can (depending on board you are using and it's support) change the foreground and background colours of the VGA output, as well as differnet scanline modes for the font.\nThese controls are mapped to memory locations you can tweak using WozMon and are reset back to defaults when the system is reset.\n\n | Register | Function | Value | Description |\n | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n | 0xC000 | Font | 00 | Default\n | | | 01 | Vertical scanlines\n | | | 02 | Horizontal scanlines\n | | | 03 | Dot mode\n | 0xC001 | Foreground | 00 | Black\n | | | 01 | Blue\n | | | 02 | Green\n | | | 03 | Cyan\n | | | 04 | Red\n | | | 05 | Magenta\n | | | 06 | Yellow\n | | | 07 | White\n | 0xC002 | Background | 00 | Black\n | | | 01 | Blue\n | | | 02 | Green\n | | | 03 | Cyan\n | | | 04 | Red\n | | | 05 | Magenta\n | | | 06 | Yellow\n | | | 07 | White\n \n## Helping\n \nAll PRs and suggestions happily accepted! Please any support us most welcome, and it would be good to have this as feature complete as possible with the real Apple1. I'd like to implement the cassette interface next with the basic electronics to talk to the headphone/mic jack of a mobile phone to upload and download recordings as a means to save programs.\n \nBut yes, help happily accepted!\n"

Note that it requires `sudo` to run due to `powermetrics` needing root access to run. `asitop` is lightweight and has minimal performance impact.\n\n**`asitop` only works on Apple Silicon Macs on macOS Monterey!**\n\n## Installation and Usage\n\n`asitop` is a Python-based command line tool. You need `pip` to download and install `asitop`. macOS already comes with Python, to install `pip`, you can follow an [online guide](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-mac). After you install `asitop` via `pip`, you can use it via the Terminal.\n\n```shell\n# to enter password before start\n# this mode is recommended!\nsudo asitop\n\n# it will prompt password on start\nasitop\n\n# advanced options\nasitop [-h] [--interval INTERVAL] [--color COLOR] [--avg AVG]\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help           show this help message and exit\n  --interval INTERVAL  Display interval and sampling interval for powermetrics (seconds)\n  --color COLOR        Choose display color (0~8)\n  --avg AVG            Interval for averaged values (seconds)\n```\n\n## How it works\n\n`powermetrics` is used to measure the following:\n\n* CPU/GPU utilization via active residency\n* CPU/GPU frequency\n* Package/CPU/GPU/ANE energy consumption\n* CPU/GPU/Media Total memory bandwidth via the DCS (DRAM Command Scheduler)\n\n[`psutil`](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) is used to measure the following:\n\n* memory and swap usage\n\n[`sysctl`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man3/sysctl.3.html) is used to measure the following:\n\n* CPU name\n* CPU core counts\n\n[`system_profiler`](https://ss64.com/osx/system_profiler.html) is used to measure the following:\n\n* GPU core count\n\nSome information is guesstimate and hardcoded as there doesn't seem to be a official source for it on the system:\n\n* CPU/GPU TDP\n* CPU/GPU maximum memory bandwidth\n* ANE max power\n* Media engine max bandwidth\n\n## Why\n\nBecause I didn't find something like this online.

The [schematics](Binary/AppleIISd.pdf) are available as PDF.\n\n## Features\n* works with ProDOS and GS/OS\n* up to 128MB storage space (4x 65535 blocks)\n* ProDOS and Smartport driver in ROM\n* Firmware update from ProDOS\n* Auto boot\n* Access LED\n* Card detect and write protect sensing\n* Skip boot when Open-Apple key is pressed\n\n## Requirements\nThe AppleIISd requires an enhanced IIe or IIgs computer. The ROM code uses some 65c02 opcodes and will therefore not work on a II, II+ or unenhanced IIe. It has been tested in the following combinations:\n* Apple IIgs Rom 01, GS/OS 6.0.4\n* Apple IIgs Rom 01, Prodos 2.4.1\n* Apple IIgs Rom 01, Prodos 1.9\n* Apple IIe enhanced, 128k, Prodos 2.4.1\n* Apple IIe enhanced, 128k, Prodos 1.9\n* Apple IIe enhanced, 64k, Prodos 1.9\n\n## Binary distribution\nThe following files in [Binary/](Binary) have been provided to eliminate the need to compile assembler or VHDL sources.\n\n| File | Purpose |\n| ---- | ------- |\n| AppleIISd_xx44.jed | CPLD bitfiles for PC44 and VQ44 formfactors |\n| AppleIISd.bin | 2k Firmware binary for EPROM |\n| AppleIISd.hex | Same as above in INTEL-HEX format |\n| AppleIISd.bom.txt | BOM for the board |\n| AppleIISd.pdf | Schematic and layout |\n| Flasher.bin | Flasher program ProDOS binary |\n| Flasher.dsk | Complete ProDOS disk image with Flasher.bin and AppleIISd.bin |\n| Gerber_Vx.x.zip | Gerber files for different hw revisions |\n\n## Smartport drive remapping\nThe AppleIISd features Smartport drivers in ROM to provide more than two drives in both GS/OS and ProDOS.\n\nAs ProDOS supports only two drives per slot, additional drives on a Smartport device are mapped to 'phantom slots'. Version prior to version 2 supported only the remapping of drives when the card was in slot 5. Starting with version 2, the remapping seems to work on all slots. The following list shows the assignments as slot/drive, when no other devices are attached:\n\n* Slot 7: 7/1, 7/2, 4/1, 4/2\n* Slot 6: 6/1, 6/2, 4/1, 4/1\n* Slot 5: 5/1, 5/2, 2/1, 2/1\n* Slot 4: 4/1, 4/2, 1/1, 1/2\n* Slot 3: 80 col HW, not usable\n* Slot 2: 2/1, 2/2, 4/1, 4/2\n* Slot 1: 1/1, 1/2, 4/1, 4/2\n\nWhen more devices are connected, things get a little confusing ;-)\n\n## Building the sources\nBe sure to have the newest version of CC65 (V2.16) and some kind of Make instaled, then type one of the following comands:\n```\nmake                            # generate binaries\nmake OPTIONS=mapfile,listing    # generate mapfile and listing, too\nmake clean                      # delete binaries\n```\nAlternatively use the VisualStudio solution.\n\n## Timing\nThe clock of the SPI bus *SCK* may be derived from either *Phi0* or the *7M* clock. Additionally, the divisor may be 2 to 8.\n\nThe following measurements were taken with the divisor set to 2, resulting in *fSCK* of 500kHz and 3.5MHz. Reading of a byte requires that a dummy byte is sent on the bus, before the answer can be read. Therefore the measurement is the time between sending the byte and receiving the answer. The measurement for reading of a whole 512 byte block includes the SD card commands to do so.\n\n| Clock  | Byte   | Block  | Image                                             |\n| -----: | -----: | -----: | ------------------------------------------------: |\n| *Phi0* | 17.7\u00b5s | 28.8ms | [Byte](Images/Bus1.gif), [Block](Images/Spi1.png) |\n| *7M*   | 3.9\u00b5s  | 15ms   | [Byte](Images/Bus2.gif), [Block](Images/Spi2.png) |\n\nThis shows that the required to read a single byte can be reduced significantly by increasing *fSCK* (as one might have guessed). Reading at 500kHz actualy requires NOPs to be inserted (or checking the TC bit in the STATUS register), while reading at 3.5MHz can be done immediately.\n\nThe time for reading a 512 byte block could *only* be halved, but there are for sure opportunities for optimization in the code surrounding the reading.\n\n```\n* single byte @ 500kHz\nLDA #$FF\nSTA $C0C0\nNOP\nNOP\nNOP\nNOP\nNOP\nNOP\nNOP\nLDA $C0C0\n\n* single byte @ 3.5MHz\nLDA #$FF\nSTA $C0C0\nLDA $C0C0\n```\n\n\n## Registers\nThe control registers of the *AppleIISd* are mapped to the usual I/O space at **$C0n0 - $C0n3**, where n is slot+8. All registers and bits are read/write, except where noted.\n\n| Address | Function        | Default value |\n| ------- | --------------- | ------------- |\n| $C0n0   | DATA            | - |\n| $C0n1   | **0:** PGMEN<br>**1:** -<br>**2:** ECE<br>**3:** -<br>**4:** FRX<br>**5:** BSY (R)<br>**6:** -<br>**7:** TC (R) | 0<br>0<br>0<br>0<br>0<br>0<br>0<br>0<br> |\n| $C0n2   | unused          | $00 |\n| $C0n3   | **0:** /SS<br>**1:** -<br>**2:** -<br>**3:** -<br>**4:** SDHC<br>**5:** WP (R)<br>**6:** CD (R)<br>**7:** INIT | 1<br>0<br>0<br>0<br>0<br>-<br>-<br>0 |\n\n**DATA** SPI data register - Is used for both input and output. When the register is written to, the controller will output the byte on the SPI bus. When it is read from, it reflects the data that was received over the SPI bus.\n\n**PGMEN** Program Enable - Enable programing of the internal firmware eeprom. Should be reset immediately after writing to the device.\n\n**ECE** External Clock Enable - This bit enables the the external clock input to the SPI controller. In the *AppleIISd*, this effectively switches the SPI clock between 500kHz (ECE = 0) and 3.5MHz (ECE = 1).\n\n**FRX** Fast Receive mode - When set to 1, fast receive mode triggers shifting upon reading or writing the SPI Data register. When set to 0, shifting is only triggered by writing the SPI data register.\n\n**BSY** Busy - This bit is 1 as long as data is shifted out on the SPI bus. *BSY* is read-only.\n\n**TC** Transfer Complete - This flag is set when the last bit has been shifted out onto the SPI bus and is cleared when *SPI data* is read.\n\n**/SS** Slave select - Write 0 to this bit to select the SD card.\n\n**SDHC** This bit is used by the initialization routine in firmware to signalize when a SDHC card was found. Do not write to manually.\n\n**WP** Write Protect - This read-only bit is 0 when writing to the card is enabled by the switch on the card.\n\n**CD** Card Detect - This read-only bit is 0 when a card is inserted.\n\n**INIT** Initialized - This bit is set to 1 when the SD card has been initialized by the firmware. Do not write manually.\n\n## TODOs\n* Much more testing\n* Enable more than 4 volumes under GS/OS\n* Support for 6502 CPUs\r\n* Support for CP/M\n\n## Known Bugs\n* Programs not startable from partitions 3 and 4 under ProDOS\n\n\n![Front_Img_Smd](Images/Card%20Front%20SMD.jpg)\n![Front_Img](Images/Card%20Front.jpg)\n"

You can style the button according to Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sign-in-with-apple/overview/).\n\n![Apple HIG themed button in black with default corner radius](docs/hig-button-black.png) ![Apple HIG themed button in white with rounder corners](docs/hig-button-white.png) ![Apple HIG themed button in outlined white with even rounder corners](docs/hig-button-white-outline.png)\n\nYou can add this button to your login screen. When tapped, the button presents Apple's OAuth login flow in a web view. After the user signs in, your callback will receive an authorization code. You can then pass the authorization code to your backend's third party login endpoint.\n\n![OAuth flow diagram](docs/flow-diagram.png)\n\n## Do I need this?\n\nYou will find this library useful if both of these statements are true:\n\n1. Your service has both an Android app and an iOS app.\n2. Your apps include third-party login, like signing in with Google, Facebook, or Twitter.\n\nIn June 2019, Apple announced Sign In with Apple, another third-party login provider. They also announced that if an iOS app offers any third-party login options, [it will be an App Store requirement](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=06032019j) to offer Sign In with Apple. This rule would go into effect \"later this year\" (2019). That is, if you don't add the feature, at some point you won't be able to ship updates to your iOS app.\n\nObviously Apple does not control Android. But if you have to add a login method to your iOS app, your users will need it on your Android app too. If it isn't supported, your users won't be able to log in if they switch to Android.\n\nWe built this library to make it as painless as possible to add Sign In with Apple to your Android app.\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Service setup\n\nFirst, follow Apple's instructions to set up Sign In with Apple [in your iOS app](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/devde676e696) and [for a web service](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/dev1c0e25352). It is the web service setup that you'll use from Android, but you need both.\n\n> More setup is necessary for backend operations, but the above is all you need to use this library. For more detail, you can read Aaron Parecki's walkthrough, [What the Heck is Sign In with Apple?](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/06/04/what-the-heck-is-sign-in-with-apple)\n\nYou should have created:\n\n- An App ID\n    - including the Sign In with Apple capability\n- A Service ID\n    - using the App ID as its primary\n    - mapped to a domain you control\n        - which Apple has verified\n    - including at least one Return URL\n\nFrom this setup, you will need two OAuth arguments to use this library:\n\n- A client ID, which you entered as the Identifier field of the Service ID.\n- A redirect URI, which you entered as the Return URL.\n\n> We recommend you use an `https://` address for your redirect URI. If you use an `http://` address, you may need to include a security configuration to allow cleartext traffic. Although this library _should_ intercept the redirect request, you should regard this as a less secure option. If it's necessary, see the [Network security configuration documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config#CleartextTrafficPermitted) for instructions on setting up a security configuration. Add that file to your Manifest's `<application>` tag using the attribute `android:android:networkSecurityConfig`.\n\n### Installation\n\nInclude as a dependency using Gradle:\n\n```groovy\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'com.willowtreeapps:signinwithapplebutton:0.3'\n}\n```\n\nSnapshot versions are also available.\n\n```groovy\nrepositories {\n    maven { url \"https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots\" }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'com.willowtreeapps:signinwithapplebutton:0.4-SNAPSHOT'\n}\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\nAdd a `SignInWithAppleButton` to your login screen's layout.\n\nConfigure the button's appearance properties in layout XML:\n\n- `style`: Specify a style, `\"@style/SignInWithAppleButton.Black\"` (default), `\"@style/SignInWithAppleButton.White\"`, or `\"@style/SignInWithAppleButton.WhiteOutline\"`.\n- `sign_in_with_apple_button_textType`: Specify an enum value, `\"signInWithApple\"` (default) or `\"continueWithApple\"`.\n- `sign_in_with_apple_button_cornerRadius`: Specify a dimension, like `\"4dp\"` (default), `\"0dp\"`, `\"8px\"`, etc.\n\n> These options are based on the style options from Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sign-in-with-apple/overview/).\n\nAt runtime, create an instance of `SignInWithAppleConfiguration`, supplying these values:\n\n- `clientId`: Use the client ID value from service setup.\n- `redirectUri`: Use the redirect URI value from service setup.\n- `scope`: Specify a space-delimited string of OpenID scopes, like \"name email\".\n\n> According to our understanding of OpenID Connect, the \"openid\" scope should be included. But at this time of writing, that causes the authentication page to fail to initialize. Beta idiosyncrasies like these are documented in [How Sign in with Apple differs from OpenID Connect](https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/src/default/How-Sign-in-with-Apple-differs-from-OpenID-Connect.md).\n\nConfigure the button with a `FragmentManager` to present the login interface, the service you created above, and a callback to receive the success/failure/cancel result.\n\n#### Example\n\nSet up a `SignInWithAppleButton` via XML:\n\n```xml\n<com.willowtreeapps.signinwithapplebutton.view.SignInWithAppleButton\n    android:id=\"@+id/sign_in_with_apple_button\"\n    android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n    style=\"@style/SignInWithAppleButton.Black\"\n    app:sign_in_with_apple_button_textType=\"signInWithApple\"\n    app:sign_in_with_apple_button_cornerRadius=\"4dp\" />\n```\n\nIn your Activity, create the `SignInWithAppleService`, then configure the button:\n\n```kotlin\noverride fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n    ...\n\n    val configuration = SignInWithAppleConfiguration(\n        clientId = \"com.your.client.id.here\",\n        redirectUri = \"https://your-redirect-uri.com/callback\",\n        scope = \"email\"\n    )\n\n    val signInWithAppleButton = findViewById(R.id.sign_in_with_apple_button)\n    signInWithAppleButton.setUpSignInWithAppleOnClick(supportFragmentManager, configuration) { result ->\n        when (result) {\n            is SignInWithAppleResult.Success -> {\n                // Handle success\n            }\n            is SignInWithAppleResult.Failure -> {\n                // Handle failure\n            }\n            is SignInWithAppleResult.Cancel -> {\n                // Handle user cancel\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n> If configuring the button from Java, you can supply an implementation of `SignInWithAppleCallback` instead of a single callback function.\n\n### Behavior\n\nWhen the user taps the button, it will present a web view configured to let the user authorize your service as an OAuth client of their Apple ID. After the user authorizes access, Apple will forward to the redirect URI and include an authorization code. The web view will intercept this request and locate the authorization code.\n\nIf the user completes authentication, your callback will receive a `SignInWithAppleResult.Success` with the authorization code. Your backend endpoint can then phone home to Apple to [exchange the authorization code for tokens](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplerestapi/generate_and_validate_tokens), completing login.\n\nIf instead there is a failure, your callback will receive a `SignInWithAppleResult.Failure` with the error.\n\nIf the user dismisses the authentication screen intentionally, you will receive a `SignInWithAppleResult.Cancel`.\n\n> If you supplied a `SignInWithAppleCallback` implementation rather than a single callback function, you will instead receive a call to the corresponding callback method.\n\n## Sample application\n\nWe've included a sample Android app in the `sample` folder. This app is comparable to [Apple's sample project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/adding_the_sign_in_with_apple_flow_to_your_app) for the [iOS Sign In with Apple button](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationappleidbutton).\n\nThe sample app demonstrates:\n\n1. Adding the button and styling it, in `activity_sample.xml`\n2. Configuring the button with service details and a client, in `SampleActivity.onCreate()` or `SampleJavaActivity.onCreate()`\n3. Making use of the authorization code on success, in the callback\n\nYou can adjust this sample project with your service configuration and try signing in.\n\n> `SampleActivity`, the Kotlin sample implementation, is launched by the sample app. To view `SampleJavaActivity`, you would need to update the activity name in the sample app's manifest XML.\n\n## Related projects\n\n- Front end components offering a Sign In with Apple button\n    - [Juice](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/adding_the_sign_in_with_apple_flow_to_your_app), Apple's sample project, as seen in [WWDC 2019, Session 706 - Introducing Sign In with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc19/706/)\n    - [@react-native-community/apple-authentication](https://github.com/react-native-community/apple-authentication), a React Native library\n    - [OmniAuth::Apple](https://github.com/nhosoya/omniauth-apple), an OmniAuth strategy for Rails web apps\n- Backend components for Sign In with Apple\n    - [apple-auth](https://github.com/ananay/apple-auth), an NPM package for JavaScript backends\n    - [apple_id](https://github.com/nov/apple_id), a gem for Ruby backends\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- Use a Chrome Custom Tab on Marshmallow and later so users know they are not being phished\n    - This will require consuming apps to configure App Links, but it's the Right Way to do it for OAuth security\n- Keep up with changes to Sign In with Apple during beta; 1.0 when the service itself is 1.0\n- Standard Android ripple effect? Material-themed Sign In with Apple button?\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome.

A token can be generated by \ncalling the `GenerateClientSecret` function included. Check [secret.go](apple/secret.go) to see exactly how to obtain the \nparameters required by the function. Note that your account might not have permissions to view/create `service IDs` and \n`keys` required by this function. \n\n```\nimport \"github.com/Timothylock/go-signin-with-apple/apple\"\n\n...\n\n// Your 10-character Team ID\nteam_id := \"XXXXXXXXXX\"\n\n// Your Services ID, e.g. com.aaronparecki.services\nclient_id := \"come.change.me\"\n\n// Find the 10-char Key ID value from the portal\nkey_id := \"XXXXXXXXXX\"\n\nsecret := `Your key that starts in -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----`\n\nsecret, _ := apples.GenerateClientSecret(secret, team_id, client_id, key_id)\nfmt.Println(secret)\n```\n\n### Validating Token\nTo validate a token, you must create a new validation `Client` then call the respective `Verify` function.\n\n```\nimport \"github.com/Timothylock/go-signin-with-apple/apple\"\n\n...\n\n// Generate a new validation client\nclient := apple.New()\n\nvReq := apple.AppValidationTokenRequest{\n\tClientID:     clientID,\n\tClientSecret: secret,\n\tCode:         \"the_token_to_validate\",\n}\n\nvar resp apple.ValidationResponse\n\n// Do the verification\nclient.VerifyAppToken(context.Background(), vReq, &resp)\n\n```\n\n### Obtaining Unique Subject ID\nA subject ID is included in the `id_token` field of the response which when decoded, has a subject that can \nuniquely identify the user. A helper function is included to obtain this subject ID: `GetUniqueID`\n\n```\nimport \"github.com/Timothylock/go-signin-with-apple/apple\"\n\n... Code to validate token ...\n\nreflect.TypeOf(response)         // ValidationResponse\nreflect.TypeOf(response.IdToken) // String\n\n\nid := apple.GetUniqueID(response.IdToken)\nfmt.Println(id)\n```\n\n### Obtaining Email\nApple recently added support for the including information about the user in their response. As of right now, you have \naccess to the following: \n- email\n- email_verified - whether or not the user has validated their email with Apple\n- private_email - whether or not the email is a private relay email from Apple\n\n```$xslt\nimport \"github.com/Timothylock/go-signin-with-apple/apple\"\n\n... Code to validate token ...\n\nreflect.TypeOf(response)         // ValidationResponse\nreflect.TypeOf(response.IdToken) // String\n\n\nclaim, _ := apple.GetClaims(resp.IDToken)\n\nemail := (*claim)[\"email\"]\nemailVerified := (*claim)[\"email_verified\"]\nisPrivateEmail := (*claim)[\"is_private_email\"]\n```\n\n## Contributing\nMake sure tests pass, submit a PR, and lets get going! \n\n## License\ngo-signin-with-apple is licensed under the MIT.\n"

With React Native, you use native UI controls and have full access to the native platform.\n\n- **Declarative.** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.\n- **Component-Based.** Build encapsulated components that manage their state, then compose them to make complex UIs.\n- **Developer Velocity.** See local changes in seconds. Changes to JavaScript code can be live reloaded without rebuilding the native app.\n- **Portability.** Reuse code across iOS, Android, and [other platforms][p].\n\nReact Native is developed and supported by many companies and individual core contributors. Find out more in our [ecosystem overview][e].\n\n[r]: https://reactjs.org/\n[p]: https://reactnative.dev/docs/out-of-tree-platforms\n[e]: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/HEAD/ECOSYSTEM.md\n\n## Contents\n\n- [Requirements](#-requirements)\n- [Building your first React Native app](#-building-your-first-react-native-app)\n- [Documentation](#-documentation)\n- [Upgrading](#-upgrading)\n- [How to Contribute](#-how-to-contribute)\n- [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)\n- [License](#-license)\n\n\n## \ud83d\udccb Requirements\n\nReact Native apps may target iOS 11.0 and Android 5.0 (API 21) or newer.

  "readme_contents": "# JW Showcase for Apple TV\n\nThis app enables you to easily put your JW Player-hosted video content on the new Apple TV\u00ae with no coding and minimal configuration. It works with any JW Player edition, from Free to Enterprise (note that usage will count against your monthly JW streaming limits).\n\nYou can use the app with other content delivery platforms (or your own web server), but you will need to modify the source code.\n\nNOTE: The app is only supported on 4th Generation (2015) Apple TV devices.\n\n## Supported features\n\n- Populates your app's media content using RSS feeds. If you are using JW Platform, this happens auto-magically based on playlists that you specify. Using RSS feeds from other sources will require you to hack the source code.\n- Video titles, descriptions and hero images populated from RSS feed metadata.\n- Playback of HLS video content from JW Platform playlists. You can add external URLs (for example, from your own server or CDN) to your playlists in the Content tab of your JW Player account dashboard, but they must be HLS.\n- Auto Advancing of playlists, when a video in a playlist has completed playback, JW Player can automatically play the next item in the playlist.\n- Customize the user interface with your own branding. The default app is configured for JW Player branding and content but you can easily change this to use your own assets by modifying the config.json file. Advanced customization is possible, but you will need to modify the source code.\n- Basic playback analytics reporting to your JW Dashboard.\n- Search and Recommendations (requires JW Recommendations entitlement).\n\n### Unsupported Features\n\nDue to the lack of UIWebView support in tvOS, our app framework is not based on the HTML5 JW Player, so some features are not yet implemented. We will continue to add features and always welcome pull requests from the community.\n\n- Ad integrations (VAST, VPAID, GoogleIMA, etc.)\n- Security-related features (encrypted HLS, DRM, signed URLs)\n- Captions\n\n## Advertising Support\n\n- We are Beta testing preroll, midroll and postroll advertising using VAST and VMAP. If you would like to be a Beta tester, [contact JW Player](https://www.jwplayer.com/contact-us/).\n\n## Advertising Support\n\n- We are Beta testing preroll, midroll and postroll advertising using VAST and VMAP. If you would like to be a Beta tester, [contact JW Player](https://www.jwplayer.com/contact-us/).\n\n## Usage Instructions (JW Platform integration)\n\n1. Log in to your [JW Player Dashboard](https://dashboard.jwplayer.com). If you do not have an account, you can [create a free one](http://www.jwplayer.com).\n1. Click Account > Properties > Settings gear icon and copy the API key (for example, `WT2yg4NU`) for the desired property.\n1. Return to the main dashboard screen. Under Playlists, click Curated, then click the title of a playlist that you want to include in your app.\n1. In the playlist details page that opens, record the Playlist ID (for example, `PQkCnnIH`). Repeat this for all the playlists that you want in your app. You can add as many playlists as you want and also specify one \"featured\" playlist.\n1. Clone this repo or [download the Zip  archive](https://github.com/jwplayer/appletv/archive/master.zip).\n1. Copy the `jwplayer-appletv-web-app` directory to your web app server.\n1. In the `jwplayer-appletv-web-app/resources/configs` directory, rename the `VCyJXbpY` directory to the JW Player API key that you recorded in step 2.\n1. Open the `config.json` file in a text editor and replace the default values with your own (playlists, images, etc). The recommended image sizes are 1920x1080 for the `splashScreen` image and 1920x400 for the `bannerImage`.\n1. Open the `jwplayer-appletv-tvos-app/jwplayer-for-tv.xcodeproj` project in Xcode.\n1. Open the `AppDelegate.swift` file. Change the `TVBaseURL` and `TVConfigURL` variables to your web app server location.\n1. Open the `Info.plist` file. Change the `jwplayer.account_key` value to the JW Player API key that you recorded in step 2, and the `Bundle name` to your desired app name.\n2. Open the `Assets.xcassets` bundle and replace the top shelf and default app icon assets with your own images. For image specs, see the [AppleTV Branding Guide](jwplayer-appletv-app-branding.pdf) in this repo. You can further customize your app by styling the TVML templates. See the [TVML documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/tvos/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/ATV_Template_Guide/index.html) for more details.\n1. Build the project in Xcode. We recommend running the app in the Xcode Apple TV emulator to test that everything is configured properly. For instructions on using the emulator, see the Xcode documentation.\n1. Submit your app to the Apple App Store. (See [instructions and guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/tvos/submit/))\n\n## Auto Advance\n\nYou can enable auto advance by editing `config.json`, and setting the `autoAdvance` boolean to true.\nThe Auto Advance feature has the following configuration options:\n\n* `autoAdvanceWarningOffset`: The amount of seconds before the end of playback of the current item to show the `autoAdvanceMessage`.\n* `autoAdvanceMessage`: The message to display before auto advancing to the next playlist item, this message takes one variable, `{$offset}`, which is the number of seconds remaining before the next video starts.\n\n## Search and Recommendations\n\nIf you're a customer who has [JW Recommendations](https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/2191721-jw-recommendations) enabled (formerly called Feeds), you can make use of Search and Recommendations playlists. If you have a Search playlist specified, a Search box will appear in your Apple TV app UI. The Recommendations playlist will be used to suggest related videos when a user selects a search result.\n\nTo enable search, you must specify a Search playlist ID and a Related playlist ID in your `config.json` file. The parameter for the Search playlist is `searchPlaylist` and the parameter for Recommendations playlist is `recommendationsPlaylist`.\n\nMake sure you have set up Search and Recommendations playlists through your JW Dashboard or through the [Platform API](https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/reference/v1/methods/channels/create.html).\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Apple Xcode 8 or later.\n- Apple TV 4th generation (2015) running tvOS 9.1 or later. tvOS 10 is required for the Ads support Beta.\n- A text editor.\n- An HTTP server (or Amazon S3 bucket, etc.) to host your app's TVML, JavaScript, and config files.\n- An Apple Developer account (only required if you want to list your app in the Apple Store).\n\nApple TV is a registered trademark of Apple, Inc.\n"

Open the project in Xcode 9 and run it on a device with iOS 11 or on the simulator. \n\n- **Camera Demo.** Runs from a live video feed and performs a prediction as often as it can manage. (You'll need to run this app on a device, it won't work in the simulator.)\n\n![The cat demo app](Screenshot.png)\n\n> Note: Also check out [Forge](http://github.com/hollance/Forge), my neural net library for iOS 10 that comes with a version of MobileNet implemented in Metal.\n\n## Converting the weights\n\nThe repo already includes a fully-baked **MobileNet.mlmodel**, so you don't have to follow the steps in this section. However, in case you're curious, here's how I converted the original Caffe model into this .mlmodel file:\n\n1) Download the **caffemodel** file from [shicai/MobileNet-Caffe](https://github.com/shicai/MobileNet-Caffe) into the top-level folder for this project.\n\nNote: You don't have to download `mobilenet_deploy.prototxt`. There's already one included in this repo. (I added a Softmax layer at the end, which is missing from the original.)\n\n2) From a Terminal, do the following:\n\n```\n$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 env\n$ source env/bin/activate\n$ pip install tensorflow\n$ pip install keras==1.2.2\n$ pip install coremltools\n```\n\nIt's important that you set up the virtual environment using `/usr/bin/python2.7`. If you use another version of Python, the conversion script will crash with `Fatal Python error: PyThreadState_Get: no current thread`. You also need to use Keras 1.2.2 and not the newer 2.0.\n\n3) Run the **coreml.py** script to do the conversion:\n\n```\n$ python coreml.py\n```\n\nThis creates the **MobileNet.mlmodel** file.\n\n4) Clean up by deactivating the virtualenv:\n\n```\n$ deactivate\n```\n\nDone!\n\n"

If you are going to use this page, I highly recommend the [Github Table of Contents](https://github.com/arthurhammer/github-toc) web browser extension.\n\n# OS X ABI Mach-O File Format Reference\n\nThis document describes the structure of the Mach-O (Mach object) file format, which is the standard used to store programs and libraries on disk in the Mac app binary interface (ABI). To understand how the Xcode tools work with Mach-O files, and to perform low-level debugging tasks, you need to understand this information.\n\nThe Mach-O file format provides both intermediate (during the build process) and final (after linking the final product) storage of machine code and data. It was designed as a flexible replacement for the BSD\u00a0`a.out`\u00a0format, to be used by the compiler and the static linker and to contain statically linked executable code at runtime. Features for dynamic linking were added as the goals of OS X evolved, resulting in a single file format for both statically linked and dynamically linked code.\n\n## Basic Structure\n\nA Mach-O file contains three major regions (as shown in\u00a0Figure 1):\n\n- At the beginning of every Mach-O file is a\u00a0*header structure*\u00a0that identifies the file as a Mach-O file. The header also contains other basic file type information, indicates the target architecture, and contains flags specifying options that affect the interpretation of the rest of the file.\n- Directly following the header are a series of variable-size\u00a0*load commands*\u00a0that specify the layout and linkage characteristics of the file. Among other information, the load commands can specify:\n  - The initial layout of the file in virtual memory\n  - The location of the symbol table (used for dynamic linking)\n  - The initial execution state of the main thread of the program\n  - The names of shared libraries that contain definitions for the main executable\u2019s imported symbols\n- Following the load commands, all Mach-O files contain the data of one or more segments. Each\u00a0*segment*\u00a0contains zero or more sections. Each\u00a0*section*\u00a0of a segment contains code or data of some particular type. Each segment defines a region of virtual memory that the dynamic linker maps into the address space of the process. The exact number and layout of segments and sections is specified by the load commands and the file type.\n- In user-level fully linked Mach-O files, the last segment is the\u00a0*link edit*\u00a0segment. This segment contains the tables of link edit information, such as the symbol table, string table, and so forth, used by the dynamic loader to link an executable file or Mach-O bundle to its dependent libraries.\n\nVarious tables within a Mach-O file refer to sections by number. Section numbering begins at 1 (not 0) and continues across segment boundaries. Thus, the first segment in a file may contain sections 1 and 2 and the second segment may contain sections 3 and 4.\n\nWhen using the Stabs debugging format, the symbol table also holds debugging information. When using DWARF, debugging information is stored in the image\u2019s corresponding dSYM file, specified by the\u00a0`uuid_command`\u00a0structure.\n\n## Header Structure and Load Commands\n\nA Mach-O file contains code and data for one architecture. The header structure of a Mach-O file specifies the target architecture, which allows the kernel to ensure that, for example, code intended for PowerPC-based Macintosh computers is not executed on Intel-based Macintosh computers.\n\nYou can group multiple Mach-O files (one for each architecture you want to support) in one binary using the format described in\u00a0[Universal Binaries and 32-bit/64-bit PowerPC Binaries](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachORuntime/#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001298-154889).\n\nBinaries that contain object files for more than one architecture are not Mach-O files. They archive one or more Mach-O files.\n\nSegments and sections are normally accessed by name. Segments, by convention, are named using all uppercase letters preceded by two underscores (for example,\u00a0`__TEXT`); sections should be named using all lowercase letters preceded by two underscores (for example,\u00a0`__text`). This naming convention is standard, although not required for the tools to operate correctly.\n\n## Segments\n\nA segment defines a range of bytes in a Mach-O file and the addresses and memory protection attributes at which those bytes are mapped into virtual memory when the dynamic linker loads the application. As such, segments are always virtual memory page aligned. A segment contains zero or more sections.\n\nSegments that require more memory at runtime than they do at build time can specify a larger in-memory size than they actually have on disk. For example, the\u00a0`__PAGEZERO`segment generated by the linker for PowerPC executable files has a virtual memory size of one page but an on-disk size of 0. Because\u00a0`__PAGEZERO`\u00a0contains no data, there is no need for it to occupy any space in the executable file.\n\nNote: Sections that are to be filled with zeros must always be placed at the end of the segment. Otherwise, the standard tools will not be able to successfully manipulate the Mach-O file.\n\nFor compactness, an intermediate object file contains only one segment. This segment has no name; it contains all the sections destined ultimately for different segments in the final object file. The data structure that defines a\u00a0`section`\u00a0contains the name of the segment the section is intended for, and the static linker places each section in the final object file accordingly.\n\nFor best performance, segments should be aligned on virtual memory page boundaries\u20144096 bytes for PowerPC and x86 processors. To calculate the size of a segment, add up the size of each section, then round up the sum to the next virtual memory page boundary (4096 bytes, or 4 kilobytes). Using this algorithm, the minimum size of a segment is 4 kilobytes, and thereafter it is sized at 4 kilobyte increments.\n\nThe header and load commands are considered part of the first segment of the file for paging purposes. In an executable file, this generally means that the headers and load commands live at the start of the\u00a0`__TEXT`\u00a0segment because that is the first segment that contains data. The\u00a0`__PAGEZERO`\u00a0segment contains no data on disk, so it\u2019s ignored for this purpose.\n\nThese are the segments the standard OS X development tools (contained in the Xcode Tools CD) may include in an OS X executable:\n\n- The static linker creates a\u00a0`__PAGEZERO`\u00a0segment as the first segment of an executable file. This segment is located at virtual memory location 0 and has no protection rights assigned, the combination of which causes accesses to\u00a0`NULL`, a common C programming error, to immediately crash. The\u00a0`__PAGEZERO`\u00a0segment is the size of one full VM page for the current architecture (for Intel-based and PowerPC-based Macintosh computers, this is 4096 bytes or 0x1000 in hexadecimal). Because there is no data in the\u00a0`__PAGEZERO`\u00a0segment, it occupies no space in the file (the file size in the segment command is 0).\n- The\u00a0`__TEXT`\u00a0segment contains executable code and other read-only data. To allow the kernel to map it directly from the executable into sharable memory, the static linker sets this segment\u2019s virtual memory permissions to disallow writing. When the segment is mapped into memory, it can be shared among all processes interested in its contents. (This is primarily used with frameworks, bundles, and shared libraries, but it is possible to run multiple copies of the same executable in OS X, and this applies in that case as well.) The read-only attribute also means that the pages that make up the\u00a0`__TEXT`\u00a0segment never need to be written back to disk. When the kernel needs to free up physical memory, it can simply discard one or more\u00a0`__TEXT`\u00a0pages and re-read them from disk when they are next needed.\n- The\u00a0`__DATA`\u00a0segment contains writable data. The static linker sets the virtual memory permissions of this segment to allow both reading and writing. Because it is writable, the\u00a0`__DATA`\u00a0segment of a framework or other shared library is logically copied for each process linking with the library. When memory pages such as those making up the\u00a0`__DATA`\u00a0segment are readable and writable, the kernel marks them\u00a0copy-on-write; therefore when a process writes to one of these pages, that process receives its own private copy of the page.\n- The\u00a0`__OBJC`\u00a0segment contains data used by the Objective-C language runtime support library.\n- The\u00a0`__IMPORT`\u00a0segment contains symbol stubs and non-lazy pointers to symbols not defined in the executable. This segment is generated only for executables targeted for the IA-32 architecture.\n- The\u00a0`__LINKEDIT`\u00a0segment contains raw data used by the dynamic linker, such as symbol, string, and relocation table entries.\n\n## Sections\n\nThe\u00a0`__TEXT`\u00a0and\u00a0`__DATA`\u00a0segments may contain a number of standard sections, listed in\u00a0Table 1,\u00a0Table 2, and\u00a0Table 3. The\u00a0`__OBJC`\u00a0segment contains a number of sections that are private to the Objective-C compiler. Note that the static linker and file analysis tools use the section type and attributes (instead of the section name) to determine how they should treat the section. The section name, type and attributes are explained further in the description of the\u00a0`section`\u00a0data type.\n\n### Table 1: The sections of a\u00a0`__TEXT`\u00a0segment\n\n| Segment and section name  | Contents                                 |\n| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| `__TEXT,__text`           | Executable machine code. The compiler generally places only executable code in this section, no tables or data of any sort. |\n| `__TEXT,__cstring`        | Constant C strings. A C string is a sequence of non-null bytes that ends with a null byte (`'\\0'`). The static linker coalesces constant C string values, removing duplicates, when building the final product. |\n| `__TEXT,__picsymbol_stub` | Position-independent indirect symbol stubs. See \u201c[Position-Independent Code](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachOTopics/1-Articles/dynamic_code.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002528)\u201d in\u00a0*Mach-O Programming Topics*\u00a0for more information. |\n| `__TEXT,__symbol_stub`    | Indirect symbol stubs. See \u201c[Position-Independent Code](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachOTopics/1-Articles/dynamic_code.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002528)\u201d in\u00a0*Mach-O Programming Topics*\u00a0for more information. |\n| `__TEXT,__const`          | Initialized constant variables. The compiler places all nonrelocatable data declared\u00a0`const`\u00a0in this section. (The compiler typically places uninitialized constant variables in a zero-filled section.) |\n| `__TEXT,__literal4`       | 4-byte literal values. The compiler places single-precision floating point constants in this section. The static linker coalesces these values, removing duplicates, when building the final product. With some architectures, it\u2019s more efficient for the compiler to use immediate load instructions rather than adding to this section. |\n| `__TEXT,__literal8`       | 8-byte literal values. The compiler places double-precision floating point constants in this section. The static linker coalesces these values, removing duplicates, when building the final product. With some architectures, it\u2019s more efficient for the compiler to use immediate load instructions rather than adding to this section. |\n\n### Table 2: The sections of a\u00a0`__DATA`\u00a0segment\n\n| Segment and section name | Contents                                 |\n| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |\n| `__DATA,__data`          | Initialized mutable variables, such as writable C strings and data arrays. |\n| `__DATA,__la_symbol_ptr` | Lazy symbol pointers, which are indirect references to functions imported from a different file. See \u201c[Position-Independent Code](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachOTopics/1-Articles/dynamic_code.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002528)\u201d in\u00a0*Mach-O Programming Topics*\u00a0for more information. |\n| `__DATA,__nl_symbol_ptr` | Non-lazy symbol pointers, which are indirect references to data items imported from a different file.

Each load command structure contains a different set of data, depending on the load command type, so each might have a different size. In 32-bit architectures, the size must always be a multiple of 4; in 64-bit architectures, the size must always be a multiple of 8. If the load command data does not divide evenly by 4 or 8 (depending on whether the target architecture is 32-bit or 64-bit, respectively), add bytes containing zeros to the end until it does.\n\n##### Discussion\n\nTable 4\u00a0lists the valid load command types, with links to the full data structures for each type.\n\n##### Table 4: Mach-O load commands\n\n| Commands                   | Data structures          | Purpose                                  |\n| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |\n| `LC_UUID`                  | `uuid_command`           | Specifies the 128-bit UUID for an image or its corresponding dSYM file. |\n| `LC_SEGMENT`               | `segment_command`        | Defines a segment of this file to be mapped into the address space of the process that loads this file.

It also includes all the sections contained by the segment. |\n| `LC_SYMTAB`                | `symtab_command`         | Specifies the symbol table for this file. This information is used by both static and dynamic linkers when linking the file, and also by debuggers to map symbols to the original source code files from which the symbols were generated. |\n| `LC_DYSYMTAB`              | `dysymtab_command`       | Specifies additional symbol table information used by the dynamic linker. |\n| `LC_THREAD`<br />`LC_UNIXTHREAD` | `thread_command`         | For an executable file, the\u00a0`LC_UNIXTHREAD`\u00a0command defines the initial thread state of the main thread of the process.\u00a0`LC_THREAD`\u00a0is similar to\u00a0`LC_UNIXTHREAD`\u00a0but does not cause the kernel to allocate a stack. |\n| `LC_LOAD_DYLIB`            | `dylib_command`          | Defines the name of a dynamic shared library that this file links against. |\n| `LC_ID_DYLIB`              | `dylib_command`          | Specifies the install name of a dynamic shared library. |\n| `LC_PREBOUND_DYLIB`        | `prebound_dylib_command` | For a shared library that this executable is linked prebound against, specifies the modules in the shared library that are used. |\n| `LC_LOAD_DYLINKER`         | `dylinker_command`       | Specifies the dynamic linker that the kernel executes to load this file. |\n| `LC_ID_DYLINKER`           | `dylinker_command`       | Identifies this file as a dynamic linker. |\n| `LC_ROUTINES`              | `routines_command`       | Contains the address of the shared library initialization routine (specified by the linker\u2019s\u00a0`-init`\u00a0option). |\n| `LC_ROUTINES_64`           | `routines_command_64`    | Contains the address of the shared library 64-bit initialization routine (specified by the linker\u2019s\u00a0`-init`\u00a0option). |\n| `LC_TWOLEVEL_HINTS`        | `twolevel_hints_command` | Contains the two-level namespace lookup hint table. |\n| `LC_SUB_FRAMEWORK`         | `sub_framework_command`  | Identifies this file as the implementation of a subframework of an umbrella framework.

The value of this field can be any sequence of ASCII characters, although segment names defined by Apple begin with two underscores and consist of capital letters (as in\u00a0`__TEXT`\u00a0and\u00a0`__DATA`). This field is fixed at 16 bytes in length.\n\n`vmaddr`\n\nIndicates the starting virtual memory address of this segment.\n\n`vmsize`\n\nIndicates the number of bytes of virtual memory occupied by this segment.

For segments that require more memory at runtime than they do at build time,\u00a0`vmsize`\u00a0can be larger than\u00a0`filesize`. For example, the\u00a0`__PAGEZERO`\u00a0segment generated by the linker for\u00a0`MH_EXECUTABLE`\u00a0files has a\u00a0`vmsize`\u00a0of 0x1000 but a\u00a0`filesize`\u00a0of 0. Because\u00a0`__PAGEZERO`contains no data, there is no need for it to occupy any space until runtime. Also, the static linker often allocates uninitialized data at the end of the\u00a0`__DATA`\u00a0segment; in this case, the\u00a0`vmsize`\u00a0is larger than the\u00a0`filesize`. The loader guarantees that any memory of this sort is initialized with zeros.\n\n`maxprot`\n\nSpecifies the maximum permitted virtual memory protections of this segment.\n\n`initprot`\n\nSpecifies the initial virtual memory protections of this segment.\n\n`nsects`\n\nIndicates the number of section data structures following this load command.\n\n`flags`\n\nDefines a set of flags that affect the loading of this segment:\n\n- `SG_HIGHVM`\u2014The file contents for this segment are for the high part of the virtual memory space; the low part is zero filled (for stacks in core files).\n- `SG_NORELOC`\u2014This segment has nothing that was relocated in it and nothing relocated to it. It may be safely replaced without relocation.\n\n#### `segment_command_64`\n\nSpecifies the range of bytes in a 64-bit Mach-O file that make up a segment.

The loader guarantees that any memory of this sort is initialized with zeros.\n\n`maxprot`\n\nSpecifies the maximum permitted virtual memory protections of this segment.\n\n`initprot`\n\nSpecifies the initial virtual memory protections of this segment.\n\n`nsects`\n\nIndicates the number of section data structures following this load command.\n\n`flags`\n\nDefines a set of flags that affect the loading of this segment:\n\n- `SG_HIGHVM`\u2014The file contents for this segment are for the high part of the virtual memory space; the low part is zero filled (for stacks in core files).\n- `SG_NORELOC`\u2014This segment has nothing that was relocated in it and nothing relocated to it. It may be safely replaced without relocation.\n\n#### `section`\n\nDefines the elements used by a 32-bit section. Directly following a\u00a0`segment_command`\u00a0data structure is an array of\u00a0`section`\u00a0data structures, with the exact count determined by the\u00a0`nsects`\u00a0field of the\u00a0`segment_command`\u00a0structure. Declared in\u00a0`/usr/include/mach-o/loader.h`. See also\u00a0`section_64`.\n\n##### Declaration\n\n```c\nstruct\u00a0section\u00a0{\n  \u00a0char\u00a0sectname[16];\n  \u00a0char\u00a0segname[16];\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0addr;\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0size;\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0offset;\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0align;\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0reloff;\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0nreloc;\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0flags;\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0reserved1;\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0reserved2;\n};\n```\n\n##### Fields\n\n`sectname`\n\nA string specifying the name of this section. The value of this field can be any sequence of ASCII characters, although section names defined by Apple begin with two underscores and consist of lowercase letters (as in\u00a0`__text`\u00a0and\u00a0`__data`). This field is fixed at 16 bytes in length.\n\n`segname`\n\nA string specifying the name of the segment that should eventually contain this section. For compactness, intermediate object files\u2014files of type\u00a0`MH_OBJECT`\u2014contain only one segment, in which all sections are placed. The static linker places each section in the named segment when building the final product (any file that is not of type\u00a0`MH_OBJECT`).\n\n`addr`\n\nAn integer specifying the virtual memory address of this section.\n\n`size`\n\nAn integer specifying the size in bytes of the virtual memory occupied by this section.\n\n`offset`\n\nAn integer specifying the offset to this section in the file.\n\n`align`\n\nAn integer specifying the section\u2019s byte alignment. Specify this as a power of two; for example, a section with 8-byte alignment would have an align value of 3 (2 to the 3rd power equals 8).\n\n`reloff`\n\nAn integer specifying the file offset of the first relocation entry for this section.\n\n`nreloc`\n\nAn integer specifying the number of relocation entries located at\u00a0`reloff`\u00a0for this section.\n\n`flags`\n\nAn integer divided into two parts. The least significant 8 bits contain the section type, while the most significant 24 bits contain a set of flags that specify other attributes of the section. These types and flags are primarily used by the static linker and file analysis tools, such as\u00a0`otool`, to determine how to modify or display the section. These are the possible types:\n\n- `S_REGULAR`\u2014This section has no particular type. The standard tools create a\u00a0`__TEXT,__text`\u00a0section of this type.\n- `S_ZEROFILL`\u2014Zero-fill-on-demand section\u2014when this section is first read from or written to, each page within is automatically filled with bytes containing zero.\n- `S_CSTRING_LITERALS`\u2014This section contains only constant C strings. The standard tools create a\u00a0`__TEXT,__cstring`\u00a0section of this type.\n- `S_4BYTE_LITERALS`\u2014This section contains only constant values that are 4 bytes long. The standard tools create a\u00a0`__TEXT,__literal4`\u00a0section of this type.\n- `S_8BYTE_LITERALS`\u2014This section contains only constant values that are 8 bytes long. The standard tools create a\u00a0`__TEXT,__literal8`\u00a0section of this type.\n- `S_LITERAL_POINTERS`\u2014This section contains only pointers to constant values.\n- `S_NON_LAZY_SYMBOL_POINTERS`\u2014This section contains only non-lazy pointers to symbols. The standard tools create a section of the\u00a0`__DATA,__nl_symbol_ptrs`section of this type.\n- `S_LAZY_SYMBOL_POINTERS`\u2014This section contains only lazy pointers to symbols. The standard tools create a\u00a0`__DATA,__la_symbol_ptrs`\u00a0section of this type.\n- `S_SYMBOL_STUBS`\u2014\u2014This section contains symbol stubs. The standard tools create\u00a0`__TEXT,__symbol_stub`\u00a0and\u00a0`__TEXT,__picsymbol_stub`\u00a0sections of this type. See \u201c[Position-Independent Code](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/MachOTopics/1-Articles/dynamic_code.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002528)\u201d in\u00a0*Mach-O Programming Topics*\u00a0for more information.\n- `S_MOD_INIT_FUNC_POINTERS`\u2014This section contains pointers to module initialization functions. The standard tools create\u00a0`__DATA,__mod_init_func`\u00a0sections of this type.\n- `S_MOD_TERM_FUNC_POINTERS`\u2014This section contains pointers to module termination functions. The standard tools create\u00a0`__DATA,__mod_term_func`\u00a0sections of this type.\n- `S_COALESCED`\u2014This section contains symbols that are coalesced by the static linker and possibly the dynamic linker. More than one file may contain coalesced definitions of the same symbol without causing multiple-defined-symbol errors.\n- `S_GB_ZEROFILL`\u2014This is a zero-filled on-demand section. It can be larger than 4 GB. This section must be placed in a segment containing only zero-filled sections. If you place a zero-filled section in a segment with non\u2013zero-filled sections, you may cause those sections to be unreachable with a 31-bit offset. That outcome stems from the fact that the size of a zero-filled section can be larger than 4 GB (in a 32-bit address space). As a result of this, the static linker would be unable to build the output file. See\u00a0`segment_command`\u00a0for more information.\n\nThe following are the possible attributes of a section:\n\n- `S_ATTR_PURE_INSTRUCTIONS`\u2014This section contains only executable machine instructions. The standard tools set this flag for the sections\u00a0`__TEXT,__text`,\u00a0`__TEXT,__symbol_stub`, and\u00a0`__TEXT,__picsymbol_stub`.\n- `S_ATTR_SOME_INSTRUCTIONS`\u2014This section contains executable machine instructions.\n- `S_ATTR_NO_TOC`\u2014This section contains coalesced symbols that must not be placed in the table of contents (`SYMDEF`\u00a0member) of a static archive library.\n- `S_ATTR_EXT_RELOC`\u2014This section contains references that must be relocated. These references refer to data that exists in other files (undefined symbols). To support external relocation, the maximum virtual memory protections of the segment that contains this section must allow both reading and writing.\n- `S_ATTR_LOC_RELOC`\u2014This section contains references that must be relocated. These references refer to data within this file.\n- `S_ATTR_STRIP_STATIC_SYMS`\u2014The static symbols in this section can be stripped if the\u00a0`MH_DYLDLINK`\u00a0flag of the image\u2019s\u00a0`mach_header`\u00a0header structure is set.\n- `S_ATTR_NO_DEAD_STRIP`\u2014This section must not be dead-stripped. See \u201cLinking\u201d for details.\n- `S_ATTR_LIVE_SUPPORT`\u2014This section must not be dead-stripped if they reference code that is live, but the reference is undetectable.\n\n`reserved1`\n\nAn integer reserved for use with certain section types. For symbol pointer sections and symbol stubs sections that refer to indirect symbol table entries, this is the index into the indirect table for this section\u2019s entries. The number of entries is based on the section size divided by the size of the symbol pointer or stub. Otherwise, this field is set to 0.\n\n`reserved2`\n\nFor sections of type\u00a0`S_SYMBOL_STUBS`, an integer specifying the size (in bytes) of the symbol stub entries contained in the section. Otherwise, this field is reserved for future use and should be set to 0.\n\n##### Discussion\n\nEach section in a Mach-O file has both a type and a set of attribute flags. In intermediate object files, the type and attributes determine how the static linker copies the sections into the final product. Object file analysis tools (such as\u00a0`otool`) use the type and attributes to determine how to read and display the sections. Some section types and attributes are used by the dynamic linker.\n\nThese are important static-linking variants of the symbol type and attributes:\n\n- *Regular sections*. In a regular section, only one definition of an external symbol may exist in intermediate object files. The static linker returns an error if it finds any duplicate external symbol definitions.\n- *Coalesced sections*. In the final product, the static linker retains only one instance of each symbol defined in coalesced sections. To support complex language features (such as C++ vtables and RTTI) the compiler may create a definition of a particular symbol in every intermediate object file. The static linker and the dynamic linker would then reduce the duplicate definitions to the single definition used by the program.\n- *Coalesced sections with weak definitions*\u00a0Weak symbol definitions may appear only in coalesced sections. When the static linker finds duplicate definitions for a symbol, it discards any coalesced symbol definition that has the weak definition attribute set (see\u00a0`nlist`). If there are no non-weak definitions, the first weak definition is used instead. This feature is designed to support C++ templates; it allows explicit template instantiations to override implicit ones. The C++ compiler places explicit definitions in a regular section, and it places implicit definitions in a coalesced section, marked as weak definitions. Intermediate object files (and thus static archive libraries) built with weak definitions can be used only with the static linker in OS X v10.2 and later. Final products (applications and shared libraries) should not contain weak definitions if they are expected to be used on earlier versions of OS X.\n\n#### `section_64`\n\nDefines the elements used by a 64-bit section. Directly following a\u00a0`segment_command_64`\u00a0data structure is an array of\u00a0`section_64`\u00a0data structures, with the exact count determined by the\u00a0`nsects`\u00a0field of the segment_command_64 structure. Declared in\u00a0`/usr/include/mach-o/loader.h`.\n\n##### Declaration\n\n```c\nstruct\u00a0section_64\u00a0{\n  \u00a0char\u00a0sectname[16];\n  \u00a0char\u00a0segname[16];\n  \u00a0uint64_t\u00a0addr;\n  \u00a0uint64_t\u00a0size;\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0offset;\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0align;\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0reloff;\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0nreloc;\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0flags;\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0reserved1;\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0reserved2;\n  \u00a0uint32_t reserved3;\n};\n```\n\n##### Fields\n\n`sectname`\n\nA string specifying the name of this section.

It is an index into the list of images that make up the umbrella image. If this field is 0, the symbol is in the umbrella image itself. If the image is not an umbrella framework or library, this field is 0.\n\n`itoc`\n\nThe symbol index into the table of contents of the image specified by the\u00a0`isub_image`\u00a0field.\n\n##### Discussion\n\nThe two-level namespace hint table provides the dynamic linker with suggested positions to start searching for symbols in the libraries the current image is linked against.\n\nEvery undefined symbol (that is, every symbol of type\u00a0`N_UNDF`\u00a0or\u00a0`N_PBUD`) in a two-level namespace image has a corresponding entry in the two-level hint table, at the same index.\n\nThe static linker adds the\u00a0`LC_TWOLEVEL_HINTS`\u00a0load command and the two-level namespace hint table to the output file when building a two-level namespace image.\n\nBy default, the linker does not include the\u00a0`LC_TWOLEVEL_HINTS`\u00a0command or the two-level namespace hint table in an\u00a0`MH_BUNDLE`\u00a0file, because the presence of this load command causes the version of the dynamic linker shipped with OS X v10.0 to crash. If you know the code will run only on OS X v10.1 and later, you should explicitly enable the two-level namespace hints. See the linker documentation for more information.\n\n#### `lc_str`\n\nDefines a variable-length string.

A byte offset from the start of the load command that contains this string to the start of the string data.\n\n`ptr`\n\nA pointer to an array of bytes. At runtime, this pointer contains the virtual memory address of the string data. The\u00a0`ptr`\u00a0field is not used in Mach-O files.\n\n##### Discussion\n\nLoad commands store variable-length data such as library names using the\u00a0`lc_str`\u00a0data structure. Unless otherwise specified, the data consists of a C string.\n\nThe data pointed to is stored just after the load command, and the size is added to the size of the load command. The string should be null terminated; any extra bytes to round up the size should be null. You can also determine the size of the string by subtracting the size of the load command data structure from the\u00a0`cmdsize`\u00a0field of the load command data structure.\n\n#### `dylib`\n\nDefines the data used by the dynamic linker to match a shared library against the files that have linked to it.

Specifies the attributes of the shared library.\n\n##### Discussion\n\nFor each shared library that a file links against, the static linker creates an\u00a0`LC_LOAD_DYLIB`\u00a0command and sets its\u00a0`dylib`\u00a0field to the value of the\u00a0`dylib`\u00a0field of the\u00a0`LC_ID_DYLD`\u00a0load command of the target library. All the\u00a0`LC_LOAD_DYLIB`\u00a0commands together form a list that is ordered according to location in the file, earliest\u00a0`LC_LOAD_DYLIB`\u00a0command first. For two-level namespace files, undefined symbol entries in the symbol table refer to their parent shared libraries by index into this list. The index is called a\u00a0*library ordinal*, and it is stored in the\u00a0`n_desc`\u00a0field of the\u00a0`nlist`\u00a0data structure.\n\nAt runtime, the dynamic linker uses the name in the\u00a0`dyld`\u00a0field of the\u00a0`LC_LOAD_DYLIB`\u00a0command to locate the shared library. If it finds the library, the dynamic linker compares the version information of the\u00a0`LC_LOAD_DYLIB`\u00a0load command against the library\u2019s version. For the dynamic linker to successfully link the shared library, the compatibility version of the shared library must be less than or equal to the compatibility version in the\u00a0`LC_LOAD_DYLIB`\u00a0command.\n\nThe dynamic linker uses the timestamp to determine whether it can use the prebinding information. The current version is returned by the function\u00a0`NSVersionOfRunTimeLibrary`\u00a0to allow you to determine the version of the library your program is using.\n\n#### `dylinker_command`\n\nDefines the attributes of the\u00a0`LC_LOAD_DYLINKER`\u00a0and\u00a0`LC_ID_DYLINKER`\u00a0load commands.

The linker does not change the value of an absolute symbol. The\u00a0`n_sect`\u00a0field is set to\u00a0`NO_SECT`.\n- `N_SECT`\u00a0(0xe)\u2014The symbol is defined in the section number given in\u00a0`n_sect`.\n- `N_PBUD`\u00a0(0xc)\u2014The symbol is undefined and the image is using a prebound value for the symbol. The\u00a0`n_sect`\u00a0field is set to\u00a0`NO_SECT`.\n- `N_INDR`\u00a0( 0xa)\u2014The symbol is defined to be the same as another symbol. The\u00a0`n_value`\u00a0field is an index into the string table specifying the name of the other symbol. When that symbol is linked, both this and the other symbol have the same defined type and value.\n\n`n_sect`\n\nAn integer specifying the number of the section that this symbol can be found in, or\u00a0`NO_SECT`\u00a0if the symbol is not to be found in any section of this image. The sections are contiguously numbered across segments, starting from 1, according to the order they appear in the\u00a0`LC_SEGMENT`\u00a0load commands.\n\n`n_desc`\n\nA 16-bit value providing additional information about the nature of this symbol for non-stab symbols. The reference flags can be accessed using the\u00a0`REFERENCE_TYPE`mask (0xF) and are defined as follows:\n\n- `REFERENCE_FLAG_UNDEFINED_NON_LAZY`\u00a0(0x0)\u2014This symbol is a reference to an external non-lazy (data) symbol.\n- `REFERENCE_FLAG_UNDEFINED_LAZY`\u00a0(0x1)\u2014This symbol is a reference to an external lazy symbol\u2014that is, to a function call.\n- `REFERENCE_FLAG_DEFINED`\u00a0(0x2)\u2014This symbol is defined in this module.\n- `REFERENCE_FLAG_PRIVATE_DEFINED`\u00a0(0x3)\u2014This symbol is defined in this module and is visible only to modules within this shared library.\n- `REFERENCE_FLAG_PRIVATE_UNDEFINED_NON_LAZY`\u00a0(0x4)\u2014This symbol is defined in another module in this file, is a non-lazy (data) symbol, and is visible only to modules within this shared library.\n- `REFERENCE_FLAG_PRIVATE_UNDEFINED_LAZY`\u00a0(0x5)\u2014This symbol is defined in another module in this file, is a lazy (function) symbol, and is visible only to modules within this shared library.\n\nAdditionally, the following bits might also be set:\n\n- `REFERENCED_DYNAMICALLY`\u00a0(0x10)\u2014Must be set for any defined symbol that is referenced by dynamic-loader APIs (such as\u00a0`dlsym`\u00a0and\u00a0`NSLookupSymbolInImage`) and not ordinary undefined symbol references. The\u00a0`strip`\u00a0tool uses this bit to avoid removing symbols that must exist: If the symbol has this bit set,\u00a0`strip`\u00a0does not strip it.\n- `N_DESC_DISCARDED`\u00a0(0x20)\u2014Sometimes used by the dynamic linker at runtime in a fully linked image. Do not set this bit in a fully linked image.\n- `N_NO_DEAD_STRIP`(0x20)\u2014When set in a relocatable object file (file type\u00a0`MH_OBJECT`) on a defined symbol, indicates to the static linker to never dead-strip the symbol. (Note that the same bit (0x20) is used for two nonoverlapping purposes.)\n- `N_WEAK_REF`\u00a0(0x40)\u2014Indicates that this undefined symbol is a weak reference. If the dynamic linker cannot find a definition for this symbol, it sets the address of this symbol to 0. The static linker sets this symbol given the appropriate weak-linking flags.\n- `N_WEAK_DEF`\u00a0(0x80)\u2014Indicates that this symbol is a weak definition. If the static linker or the dynamic linker finds another (non-weak) definition for this symbol, the weak definition is ignored. Only symbols in a coalesced\u00a0`section`\u00a0can be marked as a weak definition.\n\nIf this file is a two-level namespace image (that is, if the\u00a0`MH_TWOLEVEL`\u00a0flag of the\u00a0`mach_header`\u00a0structure is set), the high 8 bits of\u00a0`n_desc`\u00a0specify the number of the library in which this undefined symbol is defined. Use the macro\u00a0`GET_LIBRARY_ORDINAL`\u00a0to obtain this value and the macro\u00a0`SET_LIBRARY_ORDINAL`\u00a0to set it. Zero specifies the current image. 1 through 253 specify the library number according to the order of\u00a0`LC_LOAD_DYLIB`\u00a0commands in the file. The value 254 is used for undefined symbols that are to be dynamically looked up (supported only in OS X v10.3 and later). For plug\u2013ins that load symbols from the executable program they are linked against, 255 specifies the executable image. For flat namespace images, the high 8 bits must be 0.\n\n`n_value`\n\nAn integer that contains the value of the symbol. The format of this value is different for each type of symbol table entry (as specified by the\u00a0`n_type`\u00a0field). For the\u00a0`N_SECT`\u00a0symbol type,\u00a0`n_value`\u00a0is the address of the symbol. See the description of the\u00a0`n_type`\u00a0field for information on other possible values.\n\n##### Discussion\n\nCommon symbols must be of type\u00a0`N_UNDF`\u00a0and must have the\u00a0`N_EXT`\u00a0bit set. The\u00a0`n_value`\u00a0for a common symbol is the size (in bytes) of the data of the symbol. In C, a common symbol is a variable that is declared but not initialized in this file. Common symbols can appear only in\u00a0`MH_OBJECT`\u00a0Mach-O files.\n\n#### `nlist_64`\n\nDescribes an entry in the symbol table for 64-bit architectures. Declared in\u00a0`/usr/include/mach-o/nlist.h`.\n\n##### Declaration\n\n```c\nstruct\u00a0nlist_64\u00a0{\n  \u00a0union\u00a0{\n    \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0n_strx;\u00a0\n  \u00a0} n_un;\n  \u00a0uint8_t\u00a0n_type;\n  \u00a0uint8_t\u00a0n_sect;\n  \u00a0uint16_t\u00a0n_desc;\n  \u00a0uint64_t\u00a0n_value;\n};\n```\n\n##### Fields\n\n`n_un`\n\nA union that holds an index into the string table,\u00a0`n_strx`. To specify an empty string (`\"\"`), set this value to 0.\n\n`n_type`\n\nA byte value consisting of data accessed using four bit masks:\n\n- `N_STAB`\u00a0(0xe0)\u2014If any of these 3 bits are set, the symbol is a symbolic debugging table (`stab`) entry. In that case, the entire\u00a0`n_type`\u00a0field is interpreted as a\u00a0`stab`value. See\u00a0`/usr/include/mach-o/stab.h`\u00a0for valid stab values.\n- `N_PEXT`\u00a0(0x10)\u2014If this bit is on, this symbol is marked as having limited global scope. When the file is fed to the static linker, it clears the\u00a0`N_EXT`\u00a0bit for each symbol with the\u00a0`N_PEXT`\u00a0bit set. (The\u00a0`ld`\u00a0option\u00a0`-keep_private_externs`\u00a0turns off this behavior.) With OS X GCC, you can use the\u00a0`__private_extern__`\u00a0function attribute to set this bit.\n- `N_TYPE`\u00a0(0x0e)\u2014These bits define the type of the symbol.\n- `N_EXT`\u00a0(0x01)\u2014If this bit is on, this symbol is an external symbol, a symbol that is either defined outside this file or that is defined in this file but can be referenced by other files.\n\nValues for the\u00a0`N_TYPE`\u00a0field include:\n\n- `N_UNDF`\u00a0(0x0)\u2014The symbol is undefined. Undefined symbols are symbols referenced in this module but defined in a different module. Set the\u00a0`n_sect`\u00a0field to\u00a0`NO_SECT`.\n- `N_ABS`\u00a0(0x2)\u2014The symbol is absolute. The linker does not update the value of an absolute symbol. Set the\u00a0`n_sect`\u00a0field to\u00a0`NO_SECT`.\n- `N_SECT`\u00a0(0xe)\u2014The symbol is defined in the section number given in\u00a0`n_sect`.\n- `N_PBUD`\u00a0(0xc)\u2014The symbol is undefined and the image is using a prebound value for the symbol. Set the\u00a0`n_sect`\u00a0field to\u00a0`NO_SECT`.\n- `N_INDR`\u00a0( 0xa)\u2014The symbol is defined to be the same as another symbol. The\u00a0`n_value`\u00a0field is an index into the string table specifying the name of the other symbol. When that symbol is linked, both this and the other symbol point to the same defined type and value.\n\n`n_sect`\n\nAn integer specifying the number of the section that this symbol can be found in, or\u00a0`NO_SECT`\u00a0if the symbol is not to be found in any section of this image. The sections are contiguously numbered across segments, starting from 1, according to the order they appear in the\u00a0`LC_SEGMENT`\u00a0load commands.\n\n`n_desc`\n\nA 16-bit value providing additional information about the nature of this symbol. The reference flags can be accessed using the\u00a0`REFERENCE_TYPE`\u00a0mask (0xF) and are defined as follows:\n\n- `REFERENCE_FLAG_UNDEFINED_NON_LAZY`\u00a0(0x0)\u2014This symbol is a reference to an external non-lazy (data) symbol.\n- `REFERENCE_FLAG_UNDEFINED_LAZY`\u00a0(0x1)\u2014This symbol is a reference to an external lazy symbol\u2014that is, to a function call.\n- `REFERENCE_FLAG_DEFINED`\u00a0(0x2)\u2014This symbol is defined in this module.\n- `REFERENCE_FLAG_PRIVATE_DEFINED`\u00a0(0x3)\u2014This symbol is defined in this module and is visible only to modules within this shared library.\n- `REFERENCE_FLAG_PRIVATE_UNDEFINED_NON_LAZY`\u00a0(0x4)\u2014This symbol is defined in another module in this file, is a non-lazy (data) symbol, and is visible only to modules within this shared library.\n- `REFERENCE_FLAG_PRIVATE_UNDEFINED_LAZY`\u00a0(0x5)\u2014This symbol is defined in another module in this file, is a lazy (function) symbol, and is visible only to modules within this shared library.\n\nAdditionally, the following bits might also be set:\n\n- `REFERENCED_DYNAMICALLY`\u00a0(0x10)\u2014Must be set for any defined symbol that is referenced by dynamic-loader APIs (such as\u00a0`dlsym`\u00a0and\u00a0`NSLookupSymbolInImage`) and not ordinary undefined symbol references. The\u00a0`strip`\u00a0tool uses this bit to avoid removing symbols that must exist: If the symbol has this bit set,\u00a0`strip`\u00a0does not strip it.\n- `N_DESC_DISCARDED`\u00a0(0x20)\u2014Used by the dynamic linker at runtime. Do not set this bit.\n- `N_WEAK_REF`\u00a0(0x40)\u2014Indicates that this symbol is a weak reference. If the dynamic linker cannot find a definition for this symbol, it sets the address of this symbol to 0. The static linker sets this symbol given the appropriate weak-linking flags.\n- `N_WEAK_DEF`\u00a0(0x80)\u2014Indicates that this symbol is a weak definition. If the static linker or the dynamic linker finds another (non-weak) definition for this symbol, the weak definition is ignored. Only symbols in a coalesced\u00a0`section`\u00a0can be marked as a weak definition.\n\nIf this file is a two-level namespace image (that is, if the\u00a0`MH_TWOLEVEL`\u00a0flag of the\u00a0`mach_header`\u00a0structure is set), the high 8 bits of\u00a0`n_desc`\u00a0specify the number of the library in which this symbol is defined. Use the macro\u00a0`GET_LIBRARY_ORDINAL`\u00a0to obtain this value and the macro\u00a0`SET_LIBRARY_ORDINAL`\u00a0to set it. Zero specifies the current image. 1 through 254 specify the library number according to the order of\u00a0`LC_LOAD_DYLIB`\u00a0commands in the file. For plug\u2013ins that load symbols from the executable program they are linked against, 255 specifies the executable image. For flat namespace images, the high 8 bits must be 0.\n\n`n_value`\n\nAn integer that contains the value of the symbol. The format of this value is different for each type of symbol table entry (as specified by the\u00a0`n_type`\u00a0field). For the\u00a0`N_SECT`\u00a0symbol type,\u00a0`n_value`\u00a0is the address of the symbol. See the description of the\u00a0`n_type`\u00a0field for information on other possible values.\n\n##### Discussion\n\nSee discussion in\u00a0`nlist`.\n\n#### `dysymtab_command`\n\nThe data structure for the\u00a0`LC_DYSYMTAB`\u00a0load command.

Use the same\u00a0`REFERENCE_FLAG`\u00a0constants as described in the\u00a0`nlist`\u00a0structure description.\n\n\n### Relocation Data Structures\n\n*Relocation*\u00a0is the process of moving symbols to a different address. When the static linker moves a symbol (a function or an item of data) to a different address, it needs to change all the references to that symbol to use the new address. The\u00a0*relocation entries*\u00a0in a Mach-O file contain offsets in the file to addresses that need to be relocated when the contents of the file are relocated. The addresses stored in CPU instructions can be absolute or relative. Each relocation entry specifies the exact format of the address. When creating the intermediate object file, the compiler generates one or more relocation entries for every instruction that contains an address. Because relocation to symbols at fixed addresses, and to relative addresses for position independent references, does not occur at runtime, the static linker typically removes some or all the relocation entries when building the final product.\n\nNote: In the OS X x86-64 environment scattered relocations are not used. Compiler-generated code uses mostly external relocations, in which the\u00a0`r_extern`\u00a0bit is set to 1 and the\u00a0`r_symbolnum`\u00a0field contains the symbol-table index of the target label.\n\n#### `relocation_info`\n\nDescribes an item in the file that uses an address that needs to be updated when the address is changed. Declared in\u00a0`/usr/include/mach-o/reloc.h`.\n\n##### Declaration\n\n```c\nstruct\u00a0relocation_info\u00a0{\n  \u00a0int32_t\u00a0r_address;\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0r_symbolnum : 24,\u00a0r_pcrel : 1,\u00a0r_length : 2,\u00a0r_extern : 1,\u00a0r_type : 4;\n};\n```\n\n##### Fields\n\n`r_address`\n\nIn\u00a0`MH_OBJECT`\u00a0files, this is an offset from the start of the section to the item containing the address requiring relocation. If the high bit of this field is set (which you can check using the\u00a0`R_SCATTERED`\u00a0bit mask), the\u00a0`relocation_info`\u00a0structure is actually a\u00a0`scattered_relocation_info`\u00a0structure.\n\nIn images used by the dynamic linker, this is an offset from the virtual memory address of the data of the first\u00a0`segment_command`\u00a0that appears in the file (not necessarily the one with the lowest address). For images with the\u00a0`MH_SPLIT_SEGS`\u00a0flag set, this is an offset from the virtual memory address of data of the first read/write\u00a0`segment_command`.\n\n`r_symbolnum`\n\nIndicates either an index into the symbol table (when the\u00a0`r_extern`\u00a0field is set to 1) or a section number (when the\u00a0`r_extern`\u00a0field is set to 0). As previously mentioned, sections are ordered from 1 to 255 in the order in which they appear in the\u00a0`LC_SEGMENT`\u00a0load commands. This field is set to\u00a0`R_ABS`\u00a0for relocation entries for absolute symbols, which need no relocation.\n\n`r_pcrel`\n\nIndicates whether the item containing the address to be relocated is part of a CPU instruction that uses PC-relative addressing.\n\nFor addresses contained in PC-relative instructions, the CPU adds the address of the instruction to the address contained in the instruction.\n\n`r_length`\n\nIndicates the length of the item containing the address to be relocated. The following table lists r_length values and the corresponding address length.\n\n\u200b\n\n| Value | Address length                           |\n| ----- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| 0     | 1 byte                                   |\n| 1     | 2 bytes                                  |\n| 2     | 4 bytes                                  |\n| 3     | 8 bytes. See description for the\u00a0`PPC_RELOC_BR14`\u00a0`r_type`\u00a0in\u00a0`scattered_relocation_info`. |\n\n`r_extern`\n\nIndicates whether the\u00a0`r_symbolnum`\u00a0field is an index into the symbol table (1) or a section number (0).\n\n`r_type`\n\nFor the x86 environment, the\u00a0`r_type`\u00a0field may contain any of these values:\n\n- `GENERIC_RELOC_VANILLA`\u2014A generic relocation entry for both addresses contained in data and addresses contained in CPU instructions.\n- `GENERIC_RELOC_PAIR`\u2014The second relocation entry of a pair.\n- `GENERIC_RELOC_SECTDIFF`\u2014A relocation entry for an item that contains the difference of two section addresses. This is generally used for position-independent code generation.\u00a0`GENERIC_RELOC_SECTDIFF`\u00a0contains the address from which to subtract; it must be followed by a\u00a0`GENERIC_RELOC_PAIR`\u00a0containing the address to subtract.\n- `GENERIC_RELOC_LOCAL_SECTDIFF`\u2014Similar to\u00a0`GENERIC_RELOC_SECTDIFF`\u00a0except that this entry refers specifically to the address in this item. If the address is that of a globally visible coalesced symbol, this relocation entry does not change if the symbol is overridden. This is used to associate stack unwinding information with the object code this relocation entry describes.\n- `GENERIC_RELOC_PB_LA_PTR`\u2014A relocation entry for a prebound lazy pointer. This is always a scattered relocation entry. The\u00a0`r_value`\u00a0field contains the non-prebound value of the lazy pointer.\n\nFor the x86-64 environment, the\u00a0`r_type`\u00a0field may contain any of these values:\n\n- `X86_64_RELOC_BRANCH`\u2014A CALL/JMP instruction with 32-bit displacement.\n- `X86_64_RELOC_GOT_LOAD`\u2014A MOVQ load of a GOT entry.\n- `X86_64_RELOC_GOT`\u2014Other GOT references.\n- `X86_64_RELOC_SIGNED`\u2014Signed 32-bit displacement.\n- `X86_64_RELOC_UNSIGNED`\u2014Absolute address.\n- `X86_64_RELOC_SUBTRACTOR`\u2014Must be followed by a\u00a0`X86_64_RELOC_UNSIGNED`\u00a0relocation.\n\nFor PowerPC environments, the\u00a0`r_type`\u00a0field is usually\u00a0`PPC_RELOC_VANILLA`\u00a0for addresses contained in data. Relocation entries for addresses contained in CPU instructions are described by other\u00a0`r_type`\u00a0values:\n\n- `PPC_RELOC_PAIR`\u2014The second relocation entry of a pair. A\u00a0`PPC_RELOC_PAIR`\u00a0entry must follow each of the other relocation entry types, except for\u00a0`PPC_RELOC_VANILLA`,\u00a0`PPC_RELOC_BR14`,\u00a0`PPC_RELOC_BR24`, and\u00a0`PPC_RELOC_PB_LA_PTR`.\n- `PPC_RELOC_BR14`\u2014The instruction contains a 14-bit branch displacement. If the\u00a0`r_length`\u00a0is\u00a0`3`, the branch was statically predicted by setting or clearing the Y bit depending on the sign of the displacement or the opcode.\n- `PPC_RELOC_BR24`\u2014The instruction contains a 24-bit branch displacement.\n- `PPC_RELOC_HI16`\u2014The instruction contains the high 16 bits of a relocatable expression. The next relocation entry must be a\u00a0`PPC_RELOC_PAIR`\u00a0specifying the low 16 bits of the expression in the low 16 bits of the\u00a0`r_value`\u00a0field.\n- `PPC_RELOC_LO16`\u2014The instruction contains the low 16 bits of an address. The next relocation entry must be a\u00a0`PPC_RELOC_PAIR`\u00a0specifying the high 16 bits of the expression in the low (*not*\u00a0the high) 16 bits of the\u00a0`r_value`\u00a0field.\n- `PPC_RELOC_HA16`\u2014Same as the\u00a0`PPC_RELOC_HI16`\u00a0except the low 16 bits and the high 16 bits are added together with the low 16 bits sign-extended first. This means if bit 15 of the low 16 bits is set, the high 16 bits stored in the instruction are adjusted.\n- `PPC_RELOC_LO14`\u2014Same as\u00a0`PPC_RELOC_LO16`\u00a0except that the low 2 bits are not stored in the CPU instruction and are always 0.\u00a0`PPC_RELOC_LO14`\u00a0is used in 64-bit load/store instructions.\n- `PPC_RELOC_SECTDIFF`\u2014A relocation entry for an item that contains the difference of two section addresses. This is generally used for position-independent code generation.\u00a0`PPC_RELOC_SECTDIFF`\u00a0contains the address from which to subtract; it must be followed by a\u00a0`PPC_RELOC_PAIR`\u00a0containing the section address to subtract.\n- `PPC_RELOC_LOCAL_SECTDIFF`\u2014Similar to PPC_RELOC_SECTDIFF except that this entry refers specifically to the address in this item. If the address is that of a globally visible coalesced symbol, this relocation entry does not change if the symbol is overridden. This is used to associate stack unwinding information with the object code this relocation entry describes\n- `PPC_RELOC_PB_LA_PTR`\u2014A relocation entry for a prebound lazy pointer. This is always a scattered relocation entry. The\u00a0`r_value`\u00a0field contains the non-prebound value of the lazy pointer.\n- `PPC_RELOC_HI16_SECTDIFF`\u2014Section difference form of\u00a0`PPC_RELOC_HI16`.\n- `PPC_RELOC_LO16_SECTDIFF`\u2014Section difference form of\u00a0`PPC_RELOC_LO16`.\n- `PPC_RELOC_HA16_SECTDIFF`\u2014Section difference form of\u00a0`PPC_RELOC_HA16`.\n- `PPC_RELOC_JBSR`\u2014A relocation entry for the assembler synthetic opcode\u00a0`jbsr`, which is a 24-bit branch-and-link instruction using a branch island. The branch displacement is assembled to the branch island address and the relocation entry indicates the actual target symbol. If the linker is able to make the branch reach the actual target symbol, it does. Otherwise, the branch is relocated to the branch island.\n- `PPC_RELOC_LO14_SECTDIFF`\u2014Section difference form of\u00a0`PPC_RELOC_LO14`.\n\n#### `scattered_relocation_info`\n\nDescribes an item in the file\u2014using a nonzero constant in its relocatable expression or two addresses in its relocatable expression\u2014that needs to be updated if the addresses that it uses are changed. This information is needed to reconstruct the addresses that make up the relocatable expression\u2019s value in order to change the addresses independently of each other. Declared in\u00a0`/usr/include/mach-o/reloc.h`.\n\n##### Declaration\n\n```c\nstruct\u00a0scattered_relocation_info\u00a0{\n#ifdef __BIG_ENDIAN__\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0r_scattered : 1,\u00a0r_pcrel : 1,\u00a0r_length : 2,\u00a0r_type : 4,\u00a0r_address : 24;\n  \u00a0int32_t\u00a0r_value;\n#endif /* __BIG_ENDIAN__ */\n#ifdef __LITTLE_ENDIAN__\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0r_address : 24,\u00a0r_type : 4,\u00a0r_length : 2,\u00a0r_pcrel : 1,\u00a0r_scattered : 1;\n  \u00a0int32_t\u00a0r_value;\n#endif \u00a0/* __LITTLE_ENDIAN__ */\n};\n```\n\n##### Fields\n\n`r_scattered`\n\nIf this bit is 0, this structure is actually a\u00a0`relocation_info`\u00a0structure.\n\n`r_address`\n\nIn\u00a0`MH_OBJECT`\u00a0files, this is an offset from the start of the section to the item containing the address requiring relocation. If the high bit of this field is clear (which you can check using the\u00a0`R_SCATTERED`\u00a0bit mask), this structure is actually a\u00a0`relocation_info`\u00a0structure.\n\nIn images used by the dynamic linker, this is an offset from the virtual memory address of the data of the first\u00a0`segment_command`\u00a0that appears in the file (not necessarily the one with the lowest address). For images with the\u00a0`MH_SPLIT_SEGS`\u00a0flag set, this is an offset from the virtual memory address of data of the first read/write\u00a0`segment_command`.\n\nSince this field is only 24 bits long, the offset in this field can never be larger than 0x00FFFFFF, thus limiting the size of the relocatable contents of this image to 16 megabytes.\n\n`r_pcrel`\n\nIndicates whether the item containing the address to be relocated is part of a CPU instruction that uses PC-relative addressing.\n\nFor addresses contained in PC-relative instructions, the CPU adds the address of the instruction to the address contained in the instruction.\n\n`r_length`\n\nIndicates the length of the item containing the address to be relocated. A value of 0 indicates a single byte; a value of 1 indicates a 2-byte address, and a value of 2 indicates a 4-byte address.\n\n`r_type`\n\nIndicates the type of relocation to be performed. Possible values for this field are shared between this structure and the\u00a0`relocation_info`\u00a0data structure; see the description of the\u00a0`r_type`\u00a0field in the\u00a0`relocation_info`\u00a0data structure for more details.\n\n`r_value`\n\nThe address of the relocatable expression for the item in the file that needs to be updated if the address is changed. For relocatable expressions with the difference of two section addresses, the address from which to subtract (in mathematical terms, the minuend) is contained in the first relocation entry and the address to subtract (the subtrahend) is contained in the second relocation entry.\n\n##### Discussion\n\nMach-O relocation data structures support two types of relocatable expressions in machine code and data:\n\n- *Symbol address + constant*. The most typical form of relocation is referencing a symbol\u2019s address with no constant added. In this case, the value of the constant expression is 0.\n- *Address of section y \u2013 address of section x + constant*. The section difference form of relocation. This form of relocation supports position-independent code.\n\n\n## Universal Binaries and 32-bit/64-bit PowerPC Binaries\n\nThe standard development tools accept as parameters two kinds of binaries:\n* Object files targeted at one architecture. These include Mach-O files, static libraries, and dynamic libraries.\n* Binaries targeted at more than one architecture. These binaries contain compiled code and data for one of these system types:\n  * PowerPC-based (32-bit and 64-bit) Macintosh computers. Binaries that contain code for both 32-bit and 64-bit PowerPC-based Macintosh computers are are known as PPC/PPC64 binaries.\n  * Intel-based and PowerPC-based (32-bit, 64-bit, or both) Macintosh computers. Binaries that contain code for both Intel-based and PowerPC-based Macintosh computers are known as universal binaries.\n\nEach object file is stored as a continuous set of bytes at an offset from the beginning of the binary. They use a simple archive format to store the two object files with a special header at the beginning of the file to allow the various runtime tools to quickly find the code appropriate for the current architecture.\n\nA binary that contains code for more than one architecture always begins with a `fat_header` data structure, followed by two `fat_arch` data structures and the actual data for the architectures contained in the file. All data in these data structures is stored in big-endian byte order.\n\n#### `fat_header`\n\nDefines the layout of a binary that contains code for more than one architecture. Declared in the header `/usr/include/mach-o/fat.h`.\n\n##### Declaration\n\n```c\nstruct fat_header {\n  uint32_t\u00a0magic;\n  uint32_t\u00a0nfat_arch;\n};\n```\n\n##### Fields\n\n`magic`\n\nAn integer containing the value 0xCAFEBABE in big-endian byte order format. On a big-endian host CPU, this can be validated using the constant FAT_MAGIC; on a little-endian host CPU, it can be validated using the constant FAT_CIGAM.\n\n`nfat_arch`\n\n##### Discussion\n\nThe fat_header data structure is placed at the start of a binary that contains code for multiple architectures. Directly following the fat_header data structure is a set of `fat_arch` data structures, one for each architecture included in the binary. Regardless of the content this data structure describes, all its fields are stored in big-endian byte order.\n\n#### `fat_arch`\n\nDescribes the location within the binary of an object file targeted at a single architecture. Declared in `/usr/include/mach-o/fat.h`.\n\n```c\nstruct fat_arch\n{\n  \u00a0cpu_type_t\u00a0cputype;\n  \u00a0cpu_subtype_t\u00a0cpusubtype;\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0offset;\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0size;\n  \u00a0uint32_t\u00a0align;\n};\n```\n\n##### Fields\n\n`cputype`\n\nAn enumeration value of type cpu_type_t. Specifies the CPU family.\n\n`cpusubtype`\n\nAn enumeration value of type cpu_subtype_t. Specifies the specific member of the CPU family on which this entry may be used or a constant specifying all members.\n\n`offset`\n\nOffset to the beginning of the data for this CPU.\n\n`size`\n\nSize of the data for this CPU.\n\n`align`\n\nThe power of 2 alignment for the offset of the object file for the architecture specified in cputype within the binary. This is required to ensure that, if this binary is changed, the contents it retains are correctly aligned for virtual memory paging and other uses.\n\n##### Discussion\n\nAn array of `fat_arch` data structures appears directly after the `fat_header` data structure of a binary that contains object files for multiple architectures. Regardless of the content this data structure describes, all its fields are stored in big-endian byte order."

Learn more [here](https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/).*\n\n\u2003\n\n\u2003\n\u2003\u2003\n\n\n## Mac-optimized TensorFlow and TensorFlow Addons\n\n### INTRODUCTION\n\nThis pre-release delivers hardware-accelerated TensorFlow and TensorFlow Addons for macOS 11.0+. Native hardware acceleration is supported on M1 Macs and Intel-based Macs through Apple\u2019s [ML Compute](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mlcompute) framework.\n\n### CURRENT RELEASE\n\n- 0.1-alpha3\n\n### SUPPORTED VERSIONS\n\n- TensorFlow r2.4rc0\n- TensorFlow Addons 0.11.2\n\n### REQUIREMENTS\n\n- macOS 11.0+\n- Python 3.8 (required to be downloaded from [Xcode Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=command%20line%20tools) for M1 Macs).\n\n### INSTALLATION\n\nAn archive containing Python packages and an installation script can be downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos/releases).\n\n- To quickly try this out, copy and paste the following into Terminal:\n\n  ```\n  % /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apple/tensorflow_macos/master/scripts/download_and_install.sh)\"\n  ```\n\n  This will verify your system, ask you for confirmation, then create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/venv.html) with TensorFlow for macOS installed.\n\n- Alternatively, download the archive file from the [releases](https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos/releases). The archive contains an installation script, accelerated versions of TensorFlow, TensorFlow Addons, and needed dependencies.\n\n  ```\n  % curl -fLO https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos/releases/download/v0.1alpha2/tensorflow_macos-${VERSION}.tar.gz\n  % tar xvzf tensorflow_macos-${VERSION}.tar\n  % cd tensorflow_macos\n  % ./install_venv.sh --prompt\n  ```\n\n#### Installation on Conda\n\nThis pre-release version supports installation and testing using the Python from Xcode Command Line Tools. See [#153](https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos/issues/153) for more information on installation in a Conda environment.\n\n#### Notes\n\nFor M1 Macs, the following packages are currently unavailable:\n\n- SciPy and dependent packages\n- Server/Client TensorBoard packages\n\nWhen installing pip packages in a virtual environment, you may need to specify `--target` as follows:\n\n```\n% pip install --upgrade -t \"${VIRTUAL_ENV}/lib/python3.8/site-packages/\" PACKAGE_NAME\n```\n\n### ISSUES AND FEEDBACK\n\nPlease submit feature requests or report issues via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos/issues).\n\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\n#### Device Selection (Optional)\n\nIt is not necessary to make any changes to your existing TensorFlow scripts to use ML Compute as a backend for TensorFlow and TensorFlow Addons.\n\nThere is an optional `mlcompute.set_mlc_device(device_name='any')` API for ML Compute device selection. The default value for `device_name` is `'any'`, which means ML Compute will select the best available device on your system, including multiple GPUs on multi-GPU configurations. Other available options are `'cpu'` and `'gpu'`. Please note that in eager mode, ML Compute will use the CPU. For example, to choose the CPU device, you may do the following:\n\n  ```\n  # Import mlcompute module to use the optional set_mlc_device API for device selection with ML Compute.\n  from tensorflow.python.compiler.mlcompute import mlcompute\n\n  # Select CPU device.\n  mlcompute.set_mlc_device(device_name='cpu') # Available options are 'cpu', 'gpu', and 'any'.\n  ```\n\n#### Unsupported TensorFlow Features\n\nThe following TensorFlow features are currently not supported in this fork:\n\n- [tf.vectorized_map](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/vectorized_map)\n- [Higher-order gradients](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/advanced_autodiff#higher-order_gradients)\n- Jacobian-vector products (aka. [forwardprop](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/autodiff/ForwardAccumulator))\n\n\n#### Logs and Debugging\n\n##### Graph mode\n\nLogging provides more information about what happens when a TensorFlow model is optimized by ML Compute. Turn logging on by setting the environment variable `TF_MLC_LOGGING=1` when executing the model script. The following is the list of information that is logged in graph mode:\n\n- Device used by ML Compute.\n- Original TensorFlow graph without ML Compute.\n- TensorFlow graph after TensorFlow operations have been replaced with ML Compute.\n    - Look for MLCSubgraphOp nodes in this graph. Each of these nodes replaces a TensorFlow subgraph from the original graph, encapsulating all the operations in the subgraph. This, for example, can be used to determine which operations are being optimized by ML Compute.\n- Number of subgraphs using ML Compute and how many operations are included in each of these subgraphs.\n    - Having larger subgraphs that encapsulate big portions of the original graph usually results in better performance from ML Compute. Note that for training, there will usually be at least two MLCSubgraphOp nodes (representing forward and backward/gradient subgraphs).\n- TensorFlow subgraphs that correspond to each of the ML Compute graphs.\n\n\n##### Eager mode\n\nUnlike graph mode, logging in eager mode is controlled by `TF_CPP_MIN_VLOG_LEVEL`. The following is the list of information that is logged in eager mode:\n\n- The buffer pointer and shape of input/output tensor.\n- The key for associating the tensor\u2019s buffer to built the `MLCTraining` or `MLCInference` graph. This key is used to retrieve the graph and run a backward pass or an optimizer update.\n- The weight tensor format.\n- Caching statistics, such as insertions and deletions.\n\n\n##### Tips for debugging\n\n- Larger models being trained on the GPU may use more memory than is available, resulting in paging.  If this happens, try decreasing the batch size or the number of layers.\n- TensorFlow is multi-threaded, which means that different TensorFlow operations, such as` MLCSubgraphOp`, can execute concurrently. As a result, there may be overlapping logging information. To avoid this during the debugging process, set TensorFlow to execute operators sequentially by setting the number of threads to 1 (see [`tf.config.threading.set_inter_op_parallelism_threads`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/config/threading/set_inter_op_parallelism_threads)).\n- In eager mode, you may disable the conversion of any operation to ML Compute by using `TF_DISABLE_MLC_EAGER=\u201c;Op1;Op2;...\u201d`. The gradient op may also need to be disabled by modifying  the file `$PYTHONHOME/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/_grad.py` (this avoids TensorFlow recompilation).\n- To initialize allocated memory with a specific value, use `TF_MLC_ALLOCATOR_INIT_VALUE=<init-value>`.\n- To disable ML Compute acceleration (e.g. for debugging or results verification), set the environment variable `TF_DISABLE_MLC=1`.\n\n"

  "readme_contents": "# SatoChipApplet\nOpen source javacard applet implementing a Bitcoin hardware wallet with full BIP32 support.\n\n# Demonstration \n\n[![demonstrationon youtube](http://img.youtube.com/vi/ADWikh8Fxdk/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADWikh8Fxdk)\n\n# Introduction\n\nSatoChip stands for Secure Anonymous Trustless and Open Chip. It is a javacard applet that can be used as a secure hardware wallet running for example on a [Yubikey Neo](https://store.yubico.com/store/catalog/product_info.php?ref=368&products_id=72&affiliate_banner_id=1). The SatoChip has full BIP32 supports.\n\nUsing SatoChip, an initial BIP32 seed is imported in the javacard and private keys are derived as requested by an external application. *Private keys are never exported outside of the secure chip*. To improve performances, the result of key derivation is cached in secure memory for future requests so that a specific derivation path is only computed once.\n\nThe Satochip also supports the import of regular (non-BIP32 keys) such as vanity keys. Here again, private keys cannot be exported outside of the secure chip. Up to 16 regular keys can be imported on the chip. In any case, the private keys can be used to sign transactions and Bitcoin messages, if sufficient credentials are provided.\n\nAccess to private keys (creation, derivation and signature) is enforced through the use of PIN code. \n\nThe Satochip wallet is currently in Beta, use with caution! In this phase, it is strongly recommended to use the software on the Bitcoin testnet only.\nThis software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied warranty. In no event will the authors be held liable for any damages arising from the use of this software.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Code is free and open source (no NDA required!)\n- Code easy to read and maintain (java card is a subset of java)\n- Multiple form factor could be supported in addition to Yubikey (e.g sim cards)\n- Plug and play\n- Smartcards have a long experience in dealing with security and physical security in particular\n- Can be easily used or extended for other crypto-currencies\n- A test package is run during build to ensure that critical functionalities are implemented correctly\n\nAlso, if used with a Yubikey:\n- Yubikey has minimal size and is practically indestructible\n- The Yubico company is not going anywhere anytime soon! \n- Many promising functionalities: NFC, Yubikey OTP, U2F, ...\n- Possibility to use the HMAC-SHA1 challenge-response of the Yubikey as second factor for additional security against malwares\n\nDisadvantages:\n- This is still experimental code, use with caution!\n- Building the applet is a bit tricky\n- The software implementation of HMAC-SHA512 could have an potential impact on the physical security against side-channel attacks (for attackers with physical access to the chip).\n\n# Supported hardware\n\nTo support Bitcoin signatures, the javacard must support ALG_ECDSA_SHA_256, which in practice requires a javacard compliant with the JavaCard 3.0.1 specification. Note that this is a necessary but not sufficient condition since javacards typically implements only a subset of the specification.\nA detailed list of javacard and their supported features is available [here](http://www.fi.muni.cz/~xsvenda/jcsupport.html).\n\nAn interesting guide to consult before shopping can be found [here](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro/tree/master/docs/JavaCardBuyersGuide)\n\n## tested and working\n\n### Yubikey Neo\n**Important remark:** the Yubikeys currently sold by Yubico are configured for production only and it is not possible to load the applet on these dongles (see [this link](https://www.yubico.com/2014/07/yubikey-neo-updates/) for more details). Only the development Yubikeys (with serial number below 3,000,000) are suitable for our use! \n\n### NXP JCOP J2D081\nAvailable for purchase [here](http://www.javacardsdk.com/Index.aspx?p0=AAT1P0000012&p1=1&p2=1&p3=1&p4=0&p5=1) (minimum quantity order: 5 pieces)\n\n### Swissbit PS-100u VE card Secure micro SD memory card\nMore info [here](http://www.swissbit.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=293&Itemid=601)\n(Note however that Swissbit does not sell its product directly to end users but only to business partners)\n\n### J3D081 JCOP v2.4.2 R2\nAvailable [here](http://www.javacardsdk.com/product/j3d081/)\n\n# Buidl\n\nYou can build the javacard CAP files or use the last [version built](https://github.com/Toporin/SatoChipApplet/blob/master/SatoChip-2.2.2.cap).\n\nTo generate the CAP file from the sources, you can use the Eclipse IDE with the [ant-javacard](https://github.com/martinpaljak/ant-javacard) Ant task (see the instruction on the ant-javacard github repository).\n\n# Install\n\nOnce you have a CAP file, you have to download it on the chip card. You can use [GlobalPlatformPro](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro) to do this:\n\n- Download the latest release from https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro/releases\n- (Put the CAP file in the same folder as the GPJ jar file for convenience)\n- To list the applets loaded on a smartcard: `gp.exe -l`\n- To load the SatoChip applet: `gp.exe -install .\\SatoChip-2.2.2.cap`\n- To delete the SatoChip applet: `gp.exe -uninstall .\\SatoChip-2.2.2.cap`\n\nA more detailed tutorial is available on the GlobalPlatformPro [repository](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro).\n\n# Use\n\nTo use the applet, you have to connect your client application to the smartcard and send command APDU. These commands will be processed by the smartcard who will then send a response APDU. The [Electrum-Satochip](https://github.com/Toporin/electrum) is a version of [electrum](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum) that was slightly modified to integrate the Satochip hardware wallet.\n\n### Deprecated (use older releases for this)\n[SatoChipClient](https://github.com/Toporin/SatoChipClient) is a small java library that allows to easily interface the SatoChip applet to your application through a simple set of API. An example of application is the [BitcoinWallet](https://github.com/Toporin/BitcoinWallet) java application, that uses SatoChipClient through another Bitcoin library called [BitcoinCore](https://github.com/Toporin/BitcoinCore).  \n\n# Credits\n\n- The CardEdge javacard applet is derived from the [MUSCLE framework](http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/musclecard.com/info.html).\n- The Bitcoin transaction parser is derived from [Btchip](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/btchipJC).\n- The BitcoinWallet application is based on ScripterRon [BitcoinWallet](https://github.com/ScripterRon/BitcoinWallet) client and [BitcoinCore](https://github.com/ScripterRon/BitcoinCore) library.\n\n# License\n\nThis application is distributed under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3.\n\nSome parts of the code may be licensed under a different (MIT-like) license.

  "readme_contents": "# Cordova Apple Pay Plugin\n> A dependency-free Cordova plugin to provide Apple Pay functionality.\n\nUpdated to provide additional data access to the plugin, test calls, and compatibility\nwith newer versions of Cordova. Uses a Promise based interface in JavaScript.\n\nThis plugin is compatible with any payment processor (eg Stripe, Adyen etc) because\nthe payment token is handled back your JavaScript application to pass to which ever payment\nprocessor you use.\n\n## Installation\n```\n$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-applepay\n```\n\nInstall the plugin using Cordova 6 and above, which is based on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-applepay). The plugin\nexposes the `window.ApplePay` global in the browser.\n\n## Updating Entitlements\nThis plugin does not automatically update the necessary entitlements for using Apple Pay (required in production). You can update your `config.xml` to set the merchant ID with the proper entitlements. You can also do this at build / signing time when creating the app build through Xcode.\n\n```\n<!-- example for updates to config.xml -->\n<platform name=\"ios\">\n  <!-- other properties here -->\n  <config-file target=\"*-Debug.plist\" parent=\"com.apple.developer.in-app-payments\">\n    <array>\n      <string>Put your debug / developer merchant ID here</string>\n    </array>\n  </config-file>\n\n  <config-file target=\"*-Release.plist\" parent=\"com.apple.developer.in-app-payments\">\n    <array>\n      <string>Put your production merchant ID here</string>\n    </array>\n  </config-file>\n</platform>\n```\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- iOS 9.2-12\n- Requires Cordova 6 running at least iOS Platform 4.1.1\n\n## Methods\nThe methods available all return promises, or accept success and error callbacks.\n- ApplePay.canMakePayments\n- ApplePay.makePaymentRequest\n- ApplePay.completeLastTransaction\n- ApplePay.startListeningForShippingContactSelection - This does _not_ return a promise, but it fires the success callback upon shipping contact selection. See below.\n- ApplePay.updateItemsAndShippingMethods\n- ApplePay.stopListeningForShippingContactSelection\n\n## ApplePay.canMakePayments\nDetects if the current device supports Apple Pay and has any *capable* cards registered.\n\n```ecmascript 6\nApplePay.canMakePayments().then((message) => {\n  // Apple Pay is enabled. Expect:\n  // 'This device can make payments.'\n}).catch((message) => {\n  // There is an issue, examine the message to see the details, will be:\n  // 'This device cannot make payments.''\n  // 'This device can make payments but has no supported cards'\n});\n```\n\nDetects if the current device supports Apple Pay and has any cards of `supportedNetworks` and `merchantCapabilities`.\n```ecmascript 6\nApplePay.canMakePayments({\n  // supportedNetworks should not be an empty array. The supported networks currently are: amex, discover, masterCard, visa\n  supportedNetworks: ['visa', 'amex'],\n  \n  // when merchantCapabilities is passed in, supportedNetworks must also be provided. Valid values: 3ds, debit, credit, emv\n  merchantCapabilities: ['3ds', 'debit', 'credit']\n}).then((message) => {\n  // Apple Pay is enabled and a supported card is setup. Expect:\n  // 'This device can make payments and has a supported card'\n}).catch((message) => {\n  // There is an issue, examine the message to see the details, will be:\n  // 'This device cannot make payments.''\n  // 'This device can make payments but has no supported cards'\n});\n```\n\nIf in your `catch` you get the message `This device can make payments but has no supported cards` - you can decide if you want to handle this by showing the 'Setup Apple Pay' buttons instead of the\nnormal 'Pay with Apple Bay' buttons as per the Apple Guidelines.\n\n## ApplePay.makePaymentRequest\nRequest a payment with Apple Pay, returns a Promise that once resolved, has the payment token.\nIn your `order`, you will set parameters like the merchant ID, country, address requirements,\norder information etc. See a full example of an order at the end of this document.\n\n```\nApplePay.makePaymentRequest(order)\n    .then((paymentResponse) => {\n        // User approved payment, token generated.\n    })\n    .catch((message) => {\n        // Error or user cancelled.\n    });\n```\n\n### Example Response\n\nThe `paymentResponse` is an object with the keys that contain the token itself,\nthis is what you'll need to pass along to your payment processor. Also, if you requested\nbilling or shipping addresses, this information is also included.\n\n```\n{\n    \"shippingAddressState\": \"London\",\n    \"shippingCountry\": \"United Kingdom\",\n    \"shippingISOCountryCode\": \"gb\",\n    \"billingAddressCity\": \"London\",\n    \"billingISOCountryCode\": \"gb\",\n    \"shippingNameLast\": \"Name\",\n    \"paymentData\": \"<BASE64 ENCODED TOKEN WILL APPEAR HERE>\",\n    \"shippingNameFirst\": \"First\",\n    \"billingAddressState\": \"London\",\n    \"billingAddressStreet\": \"Street 1\\n\",\n    \"billingNameFirst\": \"First\",\n    \"billingPostalCode\": \"POST CODE\",\n    \"shippingPostalCode\": \"POST CODE\",\n    \"shippingAddressStreet\": \"Street Line 1\\nStreet Line 2\",\n    \"billingNameLast\": \"NAME\",\n    \"billingSupplementarySubLocality\": \"\",\n    \"billingCountry\": \"United Kingdom\",\n    \"shippingAddressCity\": \"London\",\n    \"shippingSupplementarySubLocality\": \"\",\n    \"transactionIdentifier\": \"Simulated Identifier\",\n    \"paymentMethodDisplayName\": \"MasterCard 1234\",\n    \"paymentMethodNetwork\": \"MasterCard\",\n    \"paymentMethodTypeCard\": \"credit\"\n}\n```\n\n## ApplePay.completeLastTransaction\nOnce the makePaymentRequest has been resolved successfully, the device will be waiting for a completion event.\nThis means, that the application must proceed with the token authorisation and return a success, failure, or other validation error. Once this has been passed back, the Apple Pay sheet will be dismissed via an animation.\n\n```\nApplePay.completeLastTransaction('success');\n```\n\nYou can dismiss or invalidate the Apple Pay sheet by calling `completeLastTransaction` with a status string which can be `success`, `failure`, `invalid-billing-address`, `invalid-shipping-address`, `invalid-shipping-contact`, `require-pin`, `incorrect-pin`, `locked-pin`.\n\n### Payment Flow Example\n\nThe order request object closely follows the format of the `PKPaymentRequest` class and thus its [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/PassKit/Reference/PKPaymentRequest_Ref/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/PKPaymentRequest) will make excellent reading.\n\n```\nApplePay.makePaymentRequest(\n    {\n          items: [\n              {\n                  label: '3 x Basket Items',\n                  amount: 49.99\n              },\n              {\n                  label: 'Next Day Delivery',\n                  amount: 3.99\n              },\n                      {\n                  label: 'My Fashion Company',\n                  amount: 53.98\n              }\n          ],\n          shippingMethods: [\n              {\n                  identifier: 'NextDay',\n                  label: 'NextDay',\n                  detail: 'Arrives tomorrow by 5pm.',\n                  amount: 3.99\n              },\n              {\n                  identifier: 'Standard',\n                  label: 'Standard',\n                  detail: 'Arrive by Friday.',\n                  amount: 4.99\n              },\n              {\n                  identifier: 'SaturdayDelivery',\n                  label: 'Saturday',\n                  detail: 'Arrive by 5pm this Saturday.',\n                  amount: 6.99\n              }\n          ],\n          supportedNetworks: ['visa', 'masterCard', 'discover'],\n          merchantCapabilities: ['3ds', 'debit', 'credit'],          \n          merchantIdentifier: 'merchant.apple.test',\n          currencyCode: 'GBP',\n          countryCode: 'GB',\n          billingAddressRequirement: 'none',\n          shippingAddressRequirement: 'none',\n          shippingType: 'shipping'\n    })\n    .then((paymentResponse) => {\n        // The user has authorized the payment.\n\n        // Handle the token, asynchronously, i.e. pass to your merchant bank to\n        // action the payment, then once finished, depending on the outcome:\n\n        // Here is an example implementation:\n\n        // MyPaymentProvider.authorizeApplePayToken(token.paymentData)\n        //    .then((captureStatus) => {\n        //        // Displays the 'done' green tick and closes the sheet.\n        //        ApplePay.completeLastTransaction('success');\n        //    })\n        //    .catch((err) => {\n        //        // Displays the 'failed' red cross.\n        //        ApplePay.completeLastTransaction('failure');\n        //    });\n\n\n    })\n    .catch((e) => {\n        // Failed to open the Apple Pay sheet, or the user cancelled the payment.\n    })\n```\n\nValid values for the `shippingType` are:\n\n * `shipping` (default)\n * `delivery`\n * `store`\n * `service`\n\nValid values for the `billingAddressRequirement` and `shippingAddressRequirement`\nproperties are:\n\n * `none` (default)\n * `all`\n * `postcode`\n * `name`\n * `email`\n * `phone`\n\nYou can set these as an array if you want, for example,\n`['name', 'email', 'phone']`.\n\n## Responding to User Shipping Contact Selection Events\nUse the following methods together to work with user shipping contact selection events.\n\n### ApplePay.startListeningForShippingContactSelection\nStarts listening for shipping contact selection changes Any time the user selects shipping contact, this callback will fire.  You *must* call `ApplePay.updateItemsAndShippingMethods` (see below) in response or else the user will not be able to process payment. Apple Pay waits for a completion method to be called to update these proprties before allowing the user to process payments.\n\nAny time the user updates their shipping contact, the success callback to this method will trigger. Then, you must update the items / shipping methods as a result of the user's selection.\n\nYou can also call `ApplePay.stopListeningForShippingContactSelection` to stop listening for shipping contact selection changes. Then, you no longer have to call `updateItemsAndShippingMethods` on shipping method selection.\n\n### ApplePay.updateItemsAndShippingMethods\nCall this in response to any `startListeningForShippingContactSelection` event. Provide a list similar to `makePaymentRequest` including `items` and `shippingMethods` arrays. The other properties are not used.\n\nThis method returns a promise that wraps the shipping contact selection completion method and should generally succeed.\n\n### ApplePay.stopListeningForShippingContactSelection\nCall this when you no longer need to listen to shipping contact selection events or after completing a transaction attempt.\n\nThis method returns a promise that wraps unsubscribing from the Apple Pay event internally. The Promise will be rejected if you were not subscribed to listen to these events initially.\n\n### Example\n\n```\n// Set this up initially. This will also fire if the user has a default\n// shipping contact in the apple pay sheet\nApplePay.startListeningForShippingContactSelection(async selection => {\n    const { items, shippingMethods } = getItemsAndMethodsFromAddressInfo(\n        selection.shippingAddressCity,\n        selection.shippingAddressState,\n        selection.shippingPostalCode,\n        selection.shippingISOCountryCode, // this is capitalized\n    );\n\n    try {\n        await ApplePay.updateItemsAndShippingMethods({ items, shippingMethods });\n    }\n    catch (e) {\n        // handle error if shipping contact selection couldn't complete for some reason\n    }\n});\n\ntry {\n    const response = await ApplePay.makePaymentRequest(paymentRequestOptions);\n    const success = await MyPaymentProvider.authorize(response.paymentData);\n\n    if (success) {\n        await ApplePay.completeLastTransaction('success');\n    }\n    else {\n        await ApplePay.completeLastTransaction('failure');\n    }\n}\ncatch (err) {\n    // handle payment request or transaction errors\n}\n\ntry {\n    await ApplePay.stopListeningForShippingContactSelection();\n}\ncatch (err) {\n    // handle error if you could not unsubscribe from shipping contact selection events\n}\n```\n\n## Limitations and TODOs\n* *Support more networks* - currently only Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover are accepted as config options.\n* *Event binds for delivery method selector* - An event can be raised when the customer\nselects different delivery options, so the merchant can update the delivery charges.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under *Apache 2.0*.\n\nThis project is currently maintained by [Andrew Crites](https://github.com/ajcrites).\n\nIt is originally the work of [Sam Kelleher](https://samkelleher.com/).

It will definitely be the cornerstone of Swift programming in the foreseeable future.\n\n## Get Started\n\n> If you develop a library, it's recommended to use [`CXShim`](https://github.com/cx-org/CXShim) so your library is compatible with SwiftUI.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Swift 5.0+ (Xcode 10.2+)\n\n### Installation\n\n#### Swift Package Manager (Recommended)\n\n```swift\npackage.dependencies += [\n    .package(url: \"https://github.com/cx-org/CombineX\", from: \"0.4.0\"),\n]\n```\n\n#### CocoaPods\n\n```ruby\npod 'CombineX', \"~> 0.4.0\"\n\n# or, if you want to use `Foundation` extensions: \npod 'CombineX/CXFoundation', \"~> 0.4.0\"\n```\n\n#### Carthage\n\n```carthage\ngithub \"cx-org/CombineX\" ~> 0.4.0\n```\n\n## Related Projects\n\nThese libraries bring additional functionality to Combine. They are all [Combine Compatible Package](https://github.com/cx-org/CombineX/wiki/Combine-Compatible-Package) and you're free to switch underlying Combine implementation between `CombineX` and Apple's `Combine`.\n\n- [CXTest](https://github.com/cx-org/CXTest): test infrastructure for Combine. It provides useful test utilities like `TracingSubscriber` and `VirtualTimeScheduler`.\n- [CXExtensions](https://github.com/cx-org/CXExtensions): provides a collection of useful extensions for Combine, such as `IgnoreError`, `DelayedAutoCancellable`, etc.\n- [CXCocoa](https://github.com/cx-org/CXCocoa): provides Combine extensions to `Cocoa`, such as `KVO+Publisher`, `Method Interception`, `UIBinding`, `Delegate Proxy`, etc.\n\n## License\n\nCombineX is released under the MIT license. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.\n\nThe following files are adapted from the Swift open source project:\n\n- [Publishers+KeyValueObserving](Sources/CXFoundation/Publishers+KeyValueObserving.swift)\n"

With an Apple ][+ ROM it boots to Applesoft Basic and\nruns all the programs I've tried so far.\n\nThe only I/O supported is the keyboard and screen but 40-column text, LORES\nand HIRES graphics are all supported.\n\nApplePy currently requires Pygame (although there is a minimal applepy_curses.py\nthat uses curses to display text mode only) and numpy (just for an array for\nspeaker sounds)\n\nHere's how I set up the dependencies (on Mac OS X 10.8):\n\n    pip install numpy\n    brew install sdl sdl_image sdl_mixer sdl_ttf portmidi hg\n    pip install hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis code is made available under an MIT License.

  "readme_contents": "# Send My\n\nSend My allows you to upload abritrary data from devices without an internet connection by (ab)using Apple's Find My network. The data is broadcasted via Bluetooth Low Energy and forwarded by nearby Apple devices.\n\n![Send my Overview](Resources/overview.png)\n\nThe application consists of two parts:\n- Firmware: An ESP32 firmware that turns the microcontroller into a serial (upload only) modem\n- DataFetcher: A macOS application used to retrieve, decode and display the uploaded data\n\nBoth are based on [OpenHaystack](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack), an open source implementation of the Find My Offline Finding protocol.\n\n# How it works\n\nSummary: When sending, the data is encoded in the public keys that are broadcasted by the microcontroller. Nearby Apple devices will pick up those broadcasts and forward the data to an Apple backend as part of their location reporting. Those reports can later be retrieved by any Mac device to decode the sent data.\n\nCheck https://positive.security/blog/send-my for details.\n\n# How to use\n\n## The Modem\n\n1. Change the `modem_id` (and if desired the `data_to_send` default message)\n2. Check [the Firmware README.md](Firmware/ESP32/README.md) for flashing instructions\n3. After boot, the ESP32 will immediately broadcast the default message in a loop until a new message is received via the serial interface. Messages can be sent to the modem e.g. using the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor.\n\n![ESP32 modem serial output](Resources/modem.gif)\n\n## The DataFetcher\n\n1. Install OpenHaystack including the AppleMail plugin as explained in https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack#installation\n2. Run OpenHaystack and ensure that the AppleMail plugin indicator is green\n3. Run the DataFetcher OFFetchReport application (either the Release version or build it yourself by opening `DataFetcher/DataFetcher.xcodeproj` in XCode and running the OFFetchReport target)\n4. Insert the 4 byte `modem_id` previously set in the ESP firmware as hex digits\n5. Fetch uploaded messages\n\n![Data retrieval macOS app](Resources/retriever.gif)\n\n# References\n\n- Blog Post: https://positive.security/blog/send-my\n- OpenHaystack: https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack\n- Alexander Heinrich, Milan Stute, Tim Kornhuber, Matthias Hollick.

Enable Apple Pay in your app\n\nApple has a documentation on how to do this in their _[Configuring your Environment](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/ApplePay_Guide/Configuration.html)_ guide.\n\n#### Android Pay\n\n1. Add Android Pay and Google Play Services to your dependencies\n1. Enable Android Pay in your Manifest\n\nGoogle has documentation on how to do this in their _[Setup Android Pay](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/setup)_ guide.\n\n### Importing the Library\nOnce Apple Pay/Android Pay is enabled in your app, jump into your app's entrypoint and make the `PaymentRequest` globally available to your app.\n\n```es6\n// index.ios.js\nglobal.PaymentRequest = require('react-native-payments').PaymentRequest;\n```\n\n### Initializing the Payment Request\nTo initialize a Payment Request, you'll need to provide `PaymentMethodData` and `PaymentDetails`.\n\n#### Payment Method Data\nThe Payment Method Data is where you defined the forms of payment that you accept.  To enable Apple Pay, we'll define a `supportedMethod` of `apple-pay`.  We're also required to pass a `data` object to configures Apple Pay.  This is where we provide our merchant id, define the supported card types and the currency we'll be operating in.\n\n```es6\nconst METHOD_DATA = [{\n  supportedMethods: ['apple-pay'],\n  data: {\n    merchantIdentifier: 'merchant.com.your-app.namespace',\n    supportedNetworks: ['visa', 'mastercard', 'amex'],\n    countryCode: 'US',\n    currencyCode: 'USD'\n  }\n}];\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>See Android Pay Example</strong></summary>\n<br/>\n\n```es6\nconst METHOD_DATA = [{\n  supportedMethods: ['android-pay'],\n  data: {\n    supportedNetworks: ['visa', 'mastercard', 'amex'],\n    currencyCode: 'USD',\n    environment: 'TEST', // defaults to production\n    paymentMethodTokenizationParameters: {\n      tokenizationType: 'NETWORK_TOKEN',\n      parameters: {\n        publicKey: 'your-pubic-key'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}];\n```\n\n</details>\n\n#### Payment Details\nPayment Details is where define transaction details like display items, a total and optionally shipping options.\n\nGoogle has excellent documentation for [Defining Payment Details](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/discovery-and-monetization/payment-request/deep-dive-into-payment-request#defining_payment_details).\n\n```es6\nconst DETAILS = {\n  id: 'basic-example',\n  displayItems: [\n    {\n      label: 'Movie Ticket',\n      amount: { currency: 'USD', value: '15.00' }\n    }\n  ],\n  total: {\n    label: 'Merchant Name',\n    amount: { currency: 'USD', value: '15.00' }\n  }\n};\n```\n\nOnce you've defined your `methodData` and `details`, you're ready to initialize your Payment Request.\n\n```es6\nconst paymentRequest = new PaymentRequest(METHOD_DATA, DETAILS);\n```\n\n\ud83d\udea8 _Note: On Android, display items are not displayed within the Android Pay view.  Instead, the _[User Flows documentation](https://developers.google.com/android-pay/payment-flows)_ suggests showing users a confirmation view where you list the display items.  When using React Native Payments, show this view after receiving the `PaymentResponse`._\n\n### Displaying the Payment Request\nNow that you've setup your Payment Request, displaying it is as simple as calling the `show` method.\n\n```es6\npaymentRequest.show();\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>See Screenshots</strong></summary>\n<br/>\n<img width=\"250px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1627824/27548765-be9121c0-5a4e-11e7-8e45-4b460e314e6a.png\" />\n<img width=\"250px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1627824/30039982-d565c68c-91d8-11e7-9cb9-2a0e58fffe6a.png\" />\n\n</details>\n\n### Aborting the Payment Request\nYou can abort the Payment Request at any point by calling the `abort` method.\n\n```es6\npaymentRequest.abort();\n```\n\n\ud83d\udea8 _Note: Not yet implemented on Android Pay_\n\n### Requesting Contact Information\nSome apps may require contact information from a user.  You can do so by providing a [`PaymentOptions`]() as a third argument when initializing a Payment Request. Using Payment Options, you can request a contact name, phone number and/or email.\n\n#### Requesting a Contact Name\nSet `requestPayerName` to `true` to request a contact name.\n\n```es6\nconst OPTIONS = {\n  requestPayerName: true\n};\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>See Screenshots</strong></summary>\n<br/>\n<img width=\"250px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1627824/27549933-9be15be6-5a52-11e7-868a-abcfc8867968.png\" />\n<img width=\"250px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1627824/30039983-d75d1b3e-91d8-11e7-9ac9-71d2ed12958c.png\" />\n\n</details>\n<br/>\n\n\ud83d\udea8 _Note: On Android, requesting a contact name will present the user with a shipping address selector. If you're not shipping anything to the user, consider capturing the contact name outside of Android Pay._\n\n#### Requesting a Phone Number\nSet `requestPayerPhone` to `true` to request a phone number.\n\n```es6\nconst OPTIONS = {\n  requestPayerPhone: true\n};\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>See Screenshots</strong></summary>\n<br/>\n<img width=\"250px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1627824/27549958-b6732160-5a52-11e7-8813-3beeeed03b9c.png\" />\n<img width=\"250px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1627824/30039983-d75d1b3e-91d8-11e7-9ac9-71d2ed12958c.png\" />\n\n</details>\n<br/>\n\n\ud83d\udea8 _Note: On Android, requesting a phone number will present the user with a shipping address selector. If you're not shipping anything to the user, consider capturing the phone number outside of Android Pay._\n\n#### Requesting an Email Address\nSet `requestPayerEmail` to `true` to request an email address.\n\n```es6\nconst OPTIONS = {\n  requestPayerEmail: true\n};\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>See Screenshots</strong></summary>\n<br/>\n<img width=\"250px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1627824/27549968-c172ac34-5a52-11e7-973d-8d06a3beb5ce.png\" />\n<img width=\"250px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1627824/30039982-d565c68c-91d8-11e7-9cb9-2a0e58fffe6a.png\" />\n\n</details>\n<br/>\n\nYou can also request all three by setting them all to `true`.\n\n```es6\nconst OPTIONS = {\n  requestPayerName: true,\n  requestPayerPhone: true,\n  requestPayerEmail: true\n};\n```\n\n### Requesting a Shipping Address\nRequesting a shipping address is done in three steps.\n\nFirst, you'll need to set `requestShipping` to `true` within `PaymentOptions`.\n\n```es6\nconst OPTIONS = {\n  requestShipping: true\n};\n```\n\nSecond, you'll need to include `shippingOptions` in your Payment Details.\n\n```diff\nconst DETAILS = {\n  id: 'basic-example',\n  displayItems: [\n    {\n      label: 'Movie Ticket',\n      amount: { currency: 'USD', value: '15.00' }\n    }\n  ],\n+ shippingOptions: [{\n+   id: 'economy',\n+   label: 'Economy Shipping',\n+   amount: { currency: 'USD', value: '0.00' },\n+   detail: 'Arrives in 3-5 days' // `detail` is specific to React Native Payments\n+ }],\n  total: {\n    label: 'Merchant Name',\n    amount: { currency: 'USD', value: '15.00' }\n  }\n};\n```\n\nLastly, you'll need to register event listeners for when a user selects a `shippingAddress` and/or a `shippingOption`.  In the callback each event, you'll need to provide new `PaymentDetails` that will update your PaymentRequest.\n\n```es6\npaymentRequest.addEventListener('shippingaddresschange', e => {\n  const updatedDetails = getUpdatedDetailsForShippingAddress(paymentRequest.shippingAddress;\n\n  e.updateWith(updatedDetails);\n});\n\npaymentRequest.addEventListener('shippingoptionchange', e => {\n  const updatedDetails = getUpdatedDetailsForShippingOption(paymentRequest.shippingOption);\n\n  e.updateWith(updatedDetails);\n});\n```\n\nFor a deeper dive on handling shipping in Payment Request, checkout Google's _[Shipping in Payment Request](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/discovery-and-monetization/payment-request/deep-dive-into-payment-request#shipping_in_payment_request_api)_.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 _Note: On Android, there are no `shippingaddresschange` and `shippingoptionchange` events.  To allow users to update their shipping address, you'll need to trigger a new `PaymentRequest`.  Updating shipping options typically happens after the receiving the `PaymentResponse` and before calling its `getPaymentToken` method._\n\n### Processing Payments\nNow that we know how to initialize, display, and dismiss a Payment Request, let's take a look at how to process payments.\n\nWhen a user accepts to pay, `PaymentRequest.show` will resolve to a Payment Response.\n\n```es6\npaymentRequest.show()\n  .then(paymentResponse => {\n    // Your payment processing code goes here\n\n    return processPayment(paymentResponse);\n  });\n```\n\nThere are two ways to process Apple Pay/Android Pay payments -- on your server or using a payment processor.\n\n#### Processing Payments on Your Server\nIf you're equipped to process Apple Pay/Android Pay payments on your server, all you have to do is send the Payment Response data to your server.\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f **Note:** When running Apple Pay on simulator, `paymentData` equals to `null`.\n\n```es6\nimport { NativeModules } from 'react-native';\n\npaymentRequest.show()\n  .then(paymentResponse => {\n    const { transactionIdentifier, paymentData } = paymentResponse.details;\n\n    return fetch('...', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      body: {\n        transactionIdentifier,\n        paymentData\n      }\n    })\n    .then(res => res.json())\n    .then(successHandler)\n    .catch(errorHandler)\n  });\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>See Android Pay Example</strong></summary>\n<br/>\n\n```es6\npaymentRequest.show()\n  .then(paymentResponse => {\n    const { getPaymentToken } = paymentResponse.details;\n\n    return getPaymentToken()\n      .then(paymentToken => {\n        const { ephemeralPublicKey, encryptedMessage, tag } = paymentResponse.details;\n\n        return fetch('...', {\n          method: 'POST',\n          body: {\n            ephemeralPublicKey,\n            encryptedMessage,\n            tag\n          }\n        })\n        .then(res => res.json())\n        .then(successHandler)\n        .catch(errorHandler)\n      });\n  });\n```\n\n</details>\n<br/>\n\nYou can learn more about server-side decrypting of Payment Tokens on Apple's [Payment Token Format Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/PassKit/Reference/PaymentTokenJSON/PaymentTokenJSON.html) documentation.\n\n#### Processing Payments with a Payment Processor\nWhen using a payment processor, you'll receive a `paymentToken` field within the `details` of the `PaymentResponse`.  Use this token to charge customers with your payment processor.\n\n```es6\npaymentRequest.show()\n  .then(paymentResponse => {\n    const { paymentToken } = paymentResponse.details; // On Android, you need to invoke the `getPaymentToken` method to receive the `paymentToken`.\n\n    return fetch('...', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      body: {\n        paymentToken\n      }\n    })\n    .then(res => res.json())\n    .then(successHandler)\n    .catch(errorHandler);\n  });\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>See Android Pay Example</strong></summary>\n<br/>\n\n```es6\npaymentRequest.show()\n  .then(paymentResponse => {\n    const { getPaymentToken } = paymentResponse.details;\n\n    return getPaymentToken()\n      .then(paymentToken => fetch('...', {\n        method: 'POST',\n        body: {\n          paymentToken\n        }\n      })\n      .then(res => res.json())\n      .then(successHandler)\n      .catch(errorHandler);\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n</details>\n<br/>\n\nFor a list of supported payment processors and how to enable them, see the [Add-ons](#add-ons) section.\n\n### Dismissing the Payment Request\nDismissing the Payment Request is as simple as calling the `complete` method on of the `PaymentResponse`.\n\n```es6\npaymentResponse.complete('success'); // Alternatively, you can call it with `fail` or `unknown`\n```\n\n\ud83d\udea8 _Note: On Android, there is no need to call `paymentResponse.complete` -- the PaymentRequest dismisses itself._\n\n## Testing Payments\n\n### Apple Pay\n\nThe sandbox environment is a great way to test offline implementation of Apple Pay for apps, websites, and point of sale systems. Apple offers [detailed guide](https://developer.apple.com/support/apple-pay-sandbox/) for setting up sandbox environment.\n> \u26a0\ufe0f **Note:** It is also important to test Apple Pay in your production environment. Real cards must be used in the production environment. Test cards will not work.\n>\n> \u26a0\ufe0f **Note:** There are known differences when running Apple Pay on simulator and real device. Make sure you test Apple Pay on real device before going into production.\n\n## Apple Pay Button\n\nProvides a button that is used either to trigger payments through Apple Pay or to prompt the user to set up a card.\n[Detailed docs and examples](docs/ApplePayButton.md)\n\n## Add-ons\nHere's a list of Payment Processors that you can enable via add-ons:\n- [Stripe](https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-payments/blob/master/packages/react-native-payments-addon-stripe)\n- [Braintree](https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-payments/blob/master/packages/react-native-payments-addon-braintree)\n\n\ud83d\udea8 _Note: On Android, Payment Processors are enabled by default._\n\n## API\n### [NativePayments](docs/NativePayments.md)\n### [PaymentRequest](docs/PaymentRequest.md)\n### [PaymentRequestUpdateEvent](docs/PaymentRequestUpdateEvent.md)\n### [PaymentResponse](docs/PaymentResponse.md)\n\n## Resources\n### Payment Request\n- [Introducing the Payment Request API](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/discovery-and-monetization/payment-request)\n- [Deep Dive into the Payment Request API](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/discovery-and-monetization/payment-request/deep-dive-into-payment-request)\n- [W3C API Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/)\n- [Web Payments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0LkQijSeko)\n- [The Future of Web Payments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hU89pPBmhds)\n\n### Apple Pay\n- [Getting Started with Apple Pay](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/get-started)\n- [Configuring your Environment](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/ApplePay_Guide/Configuration.html)\n- [Processing Payments](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/ApplePay_Guide/ProcessPayment.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014764-CH5-SW4)\n- [Payment Token Format Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/PassKit/Reference/PaymentTokenJSON/PaymentTokenJSON.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014929)\n\n### Android Pay\n- [Setup Android Pay](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/setup)\n- [Tutorial](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/tutorial)\n- [Brand Guidelines](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/brand-guidelines)\n- [Gateway Token Approach](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/discovery-and-monetization/payment-request/android-pay#gateway_token_approach)\n- [Network Token Approach](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/discovery-and-monetization/payment-request/android-pay#network_token_approach)\n\n# License\nLicensed under the MIT License, Copyright \u00a9 2017, [Naoufal Kadhom](https://twitter.com/naoufal).\n\nSee [LICENSE](https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-payments/blob/master/LICENSE) for more information."

For more information about the PIA service, please visit our website [privateinternetaccess.com][pia-url] or check out the [Wiki][pia-wiki].\n\n# Tunnel for Apple platforms\n\nThis library provides a simplified Swift/Obj-C implementation of the OpenVPN\u00ae protocol for the Apple platforms, while also taking advantage of the Private Internet Access [client patch customizations](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/forum/discussion/9093/pia-openvpn-client-encryption-patch). The crypto layer is built on top of [OpenSSL][dep-openssl] 1.1.0j.2, which in turn enables support for a certain range of encryption and digest algorithms.\n\n## Getting started\n\nThe client is known to work with [OpenVPN\u00ae][openvpn] 2.3+ servers. Key renegotiation and replay protection are also included, but full-fledged configuration files (.ovpn) are not currently supported.\n\n- [x] Handshake and tunneling over UDP or TCP\n- [x] Client-initiated renegotiation\n- [x] Replay protection (hardcoded window)\n- [x] Data encryption\n    - AES-CBC (128 and 256 bit)\n    - AES-GCM (128 and 256 bit)\n- [x] HMAC digest\n    - SHA-1\n    - SHA-256\n- [x] TLS CA validation\n    - RSA (2048, 3072 and 4096 bit)\n    - ECC (secp256r1, secp521r1, secp256k1)\n    - Custom certificate\n\n## Installation\n\n### Requirements\n\n- iOS 11.0+ / macOS 10.11+\n- Xcode 9+ (Swift 4)\n- Git (preinstalled with Xcode Command Line Tools)\n- Ruby (preinstalled with macOS)\n- [CocoaPods 1.5.0][dep-cocoapods]\n- [jazzy][dep-jazzy] (optional, for documentation)\n\nIt's highly recommended to use the Git and Ruby packages provided by [Homebrew][dep-brew].\n\n### CocoaPods\n\nTo use with CocoaPods just add this to your Podfile:\n\n```ruby\npod 'PIATunnel'\n```\n\n### Testing\n\nDownload the library codebase locally:\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/pia-foss/tunnel-apple.git\n\nAssuming you have a [working CocoaPods environment][dep-cocoapods], setting up the library workspace only requires installing the pod dependencies:\n\n    $ pod install\n\nAfter that, open `PIATunnel.xcworkspace` in Xcode and run the unit tests found in the `PIATunnelTests` target. A simple CMD+U while on `PIATunnel-iOS` should do that as well.\n\n#### Demo\n\nThere is a `Demo` directory containing a simple app for testing the tunnel, called `BasicTunnel`. As usual, prepare for CocoaPods:\n\n    $ pod install\n\nthen open `Demo.xcworkspace` and run the `BasicTunnel-iOS` target.\n\nFor the VPN to work properly, the `BasicTunnel` demo requires:\n\n- _App Groups_ and _Keychain Sharing_ capabilities\n- App IDs with _Packet Tunnel_ entitlements\n\nboth in the main app and the tunnel extension target.\n\nIn order to test connection to your own server rather than a PIA server, modify the file `Demo/BasicTunnel-[iOS|macOS]/ViewController.swift` and make sure to:\n\n- Replace `.pia` with `.vanilla` in `builder.endpointProtocols`.\n- Set `builder.handshake` to `.custom`.\n- Set `builder.ca` to the PEM formatted certificate of your VPN server's CA.\n\nExample:\n\n    builder.endpointProtocols = [PIATunnelProvider.EndpointProtocol(.udp, 1194, .vanilla)]\n    builder.handshake = .custom\n    builder.ca = \"\"\"\n    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n    MIIFJDCC...\n    -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n    \"\"\"\n    \n## Documentation\n\nThe library is split into two modules, in order to decouple the low-level protocol implementation from the platform-specific bridging, namely the [NetworkExtension][ne-home] VPN framework.\n\nFull documentation of the public interface is available and can be generated with [jazzy][dep-jazzy]. After installing the jazzy Ruby gem with:\n\n    $ gem install jazzy\n\nenter the root directory of the repository and run:\n\n    $ jazzy\n\nThe generated output is stored into the `docs` directory in HTML format.\n\n### Core\n\nHere you will find the low-level entities on top of which the connection is established. Code is mixed Swift and Obj-C, most of it is not exposed to consumers. The *Core* module depends on OpenSSL and is mostly platform-agnostic.\n\nThe entry point is the `SessionProxy` class. The networking layer is fully abstract and delegated externally with the use of opaque `IOInterface` (`LinkInterface` and `TunnelInterface`) and `SessionProxyDelegate` protocols.\n\n### AppExtension\n\nThe goal of this module is packaging up a black box implementation of a [NEPacketTunnelProvider][ne-ptp], which is the essential part of a Packet Tunnel Provider app extension. You will find the main implementation in the `PIATunnelProvider` class.\n\nCurrently, the extension supports VPN over both [UDP][ne-udp] and [TCP][ne-tcp] sockets. A debug log snapshot is optionally maintained and shared to host apps via `UserDefaults` in a shared App Group.\n\n## Contributing\n\nBy contributing to this project you are agreeing to the terms stated in the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) [here](/CLA.rst).\n\nFor more details please see [CONTRIBUTING](/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nIssues and Pull Requests should use these templates: [ISSUE](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) and [PULL REQUEST](/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).\n\n## Authors\n\n- Jose Blaya - [ueshiba](https://github.com/ueshiba)\n- Davide De Rosa \n- Steve\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the [MIT (Expat) license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/), which can be found [here](/LICENSE).\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n- SwiftyBeaver - \u00a9 2015 Sebastian Kreutzberger\n- OpenSSL-Apple - \u00a9 Davide De Rosa\n\nThis product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit.

Apps built as ARM64EC may contain x64 code but do not have to, since ARM64EC is its own complete, first-class ABI for Windows.\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45159366/124997795-20cf2400-e000-11eb-8954-4944286b8ea8.png\">\n  Windows 11 Desktop\n</h3>\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45159366/120387363-a9aabf80-c2de-11eb-84a5-8e4b422e7546.png\">\n  Windows 10 Desktop\n</h3>\n\n# Gaming\n[Back to the Top](https://github.com/mikeroyal/Apple-Silicon-Guide#table-of-contents)\n\n## Gaming on Apple Silicon resources\n\n - **[Apple Silicon Games](https://applesilicongames.com/games)** \n \n - **[M1 Parallels Windows compatible games list | AppleGamingWiki](https://www.applegamingwiki.com/wiki/M1_Parallels_Windows_compatible_games_list)**\n\n - **[M1 compatible Games Master List | AppleGamingWiki ](https://www.applegamingwiki.com/wiki/M1_compatible_games_master_list)**\n\n - **[Games and Apps on Apple Silicon (Compatibility Sheet) by Thomas Schranz(@__tosh on Twitter) ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1er-NivvuIheDmIKBVRu3S_BzA_lZT5z3Z-CxQZ-uPVs)**\n  \n - **[Porting Kit | Install Windows apps in Mac](https://www.portingkit.com/)**\n\n - **[MacGaming Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming)**\n \n - **[iOS Gaming Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/iosgaming/)**\n \n - **[Apple Arcade Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleArcade/)**\n\n\n## Apple Arcade\n[Back to the Top](https://github.com/mikeroyal/Apple-Silicon-Guide#table-of-contents)\n\n[Apple Arcade](https://www.apple.com/apple-arcade/) is a game subscription service that gives up to six family members unlimited access to 100+ incredibly fun games, all with no ads and no in-app purchases.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45159366/112693074-377cb100-8e3d-11eb-910c-1095c91da6d5.png\">\n</p>\n\n## Steam\n[Back to the Top](https://github.com/mikeroyal/Apple-Silicon-Guide#table-of-contents)\n\n[Get Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/)\n\n <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45159366/106686402-13100100-657f-11eb-9012-6bdac264a808.png\">\n\n [Steam Link app](https://store.steampowered.com/steamlink/about) is available free of charge, streaming your Steam PC games to phones, tablets, and TV.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45159366/112692999-14ea9800-8e3d-11eb-964a-6bee4e665900.png\">\n</p>\n\n ## Epic Games Store\n[Back to the Top](https://github.com/mikeroyal/Apple-Silicon-Guide#table-of-contents)\n\n[Heroic Game Launcher](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/) is an Open Source Game Launcher for Linux, Windows and MacOS (for both Native and Windows Games using Crossover).

Plug in an external hard drive (or configure a network storage drive), and your Mac's files are backed up.\n\nFor the average consumer, Time Machine is an excellent choice, especially considering many Mac owners may _only_ have Time Machine as a backup strategy. For developers, however, Time Machine presents a problem: **how do I keep project dependencies from taking up space on my Time Machine drive?**\n\nAsimov aims to solve that problem, scanning your filesystem for known dependency directories (e.g. `node_modules/` living adjacent to a `package.json` file) and excluding them from Time Machine backups. After all, why eat up space on your backup drive for something you could easily restore via `npm install`?\n\n\n## Installation\n\nAsimov may be installed in a few different ways:\n\n### Installation via Homebrew\n\nThe easiest way to install Asimov is through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):\n\n```sh\n$ brew install asimov\n```\n\nIf you would prefer to use the latest development release, you may append the `--head` flag:\n\n```sh\n$ brew install asimov --head\n```\n\nOnce installed, you may instruct Homebrew to automatically load the scheduled job, ensuring Asimov is being run automatically every day:\n\n```sh\n$ sudo brew services start asimov\n```\n\nIf you don't need or want the scheduled job, you may run Asimov on-demand:\n\n```sh\n$ asimov\n```\n\n### Manual installation\n\nIf you would prefer to install Asimov manually, you can do so by cloning the repository (or downloading and extracting an archive of the source) anywhere on your Mac:\n\n```sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/stevegrunwell/asimov.git --depth 1\n```\n\nAfter you've cloned the repository, run the `install.sh` script to automatically:\n* Symlink Asimov to `/usr/local/bin`, making it readily available from anywhere.\n* Schedule Asimov to run once a day, ensuring new projects' dependencies are quickly excluded from Time Machine backups.\n* Run Asimov for the first time, finding all current project dependencies adding them to Time Machine's exclusion list.\n\n\n## How it works\n\nAt its essence, Asimov is a simple wrapper around Apple's `tmutil` program, which provides more granular control over Time Machine.\n\nAsimov finds recognized dependency directories, verifies that the corresponding dependency file exists and, if so, tells Time Machine not to worry about backing up the dependency directory.\n\nDon't worry about running it multiple times, either. Asimov is smart enough to see if a directory has already been marked for exclusion.\n\n### Retrieving excluded files\n\nIf you'd like to see all of the directories and files that have been excluded from Time Machine, you can do so by running the following command ([props Brant Bobby on StackOverflow](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/25833/206772)):\n\n```bash\n$ sudo mdfind \"com_apple_backup_excludeItem = 'com.apple.backupd'\"\n```\n\nIf a directory has been excluded from backups in error, you can remove the exclusion using `tmutil`:\n\n```bash\n$ tmutil removeexclusion /path/to/directory\n```\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Iterating Over Hashes\n\n## Objectives\n\n1. Iterate over nested, or multidimensional, hashes.\n\n\n## The Holiday Suppliers\n\n### Instructions\n\nYou have a bunch of decorations for various holidays organized by season.\n\n```ruby\nholiday_supplies = {\n  :winter => {\n    :christmas => [\"Lights\", \"Wreath\"],\n    :new_years => [\"Party Hats\"]\n  },\n  :summer => {\n    :fourth_of_july => [\"Fireworks\", \"BBQ\"]\n  },\n  :fall => {\n    :thanksgiving => [\"Turkey\"]\n  },\n  :spring => {\n    :memorial_day => [\"BBQ\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWrite your methods in `lib/holiday.rb`; use the comments in each method as guides.\n\n* Write a method that returns the second supply for the Fourth of July. For eg:\n\n```ruby\ndef second_supply_for_fourth_of_july(holiday_supplies)\n  holiday_supplies[:summer][:fourth_of_july][1]\nend\n```\n\n* Write a method that adds a supply to both Winter holidays.\n\n* Write a method that adds a supply to Memorial Day.\n\n* Write a method that adds a new holiday and its associated supplies to any season.\n\n* Write a method to collect all Winter supplies from all the winter holidays. For eg:\n\n```bash\nwinter_supplies(holiday_supplies) #=> [\"Lights\", \"Wreath\", etc]\n```\n\n* Write a method that uses a loop to list out all the supplies you have for each holiday and the season. Use string manipulation to get your output to match what the test is expecting.\n\n* Here are a few helpful tips:\n  * Our hash keys are symbols. We need to convert them into strings. Use the `.to_s` method on a symbol to convert it into a string.\n  * Look closely at the output string that the test is expecting. You'll notice that it expects holiday names, like \"New Years\", to have both words capitalized. Ruby has a `.capitalize` method that you can call on a string. **But, note:**\n    * `.capitalize` returns the capitalized string but *doesn't change* the original string. So, when you call on that same string in the future, it *isn't capitalized!* You can capitalize a string for now and evermore by using the bang operator (`!`).\n    * You'll need to capitalize *both words* in a given holiday's name. If you call `\"new years\".capitalize!`, it will return `\"New years\"`. In order to capitalize *both* words, you'll need to `.split` the string into an array and iterate over that array to `.capitalize!` each word in it. Then, you'll need to `.join` the array back into a string.\n    * If you're unfamiliar with the methods mentioned above, look them up in the Ruby documentation.\n\nExample of expected output:\n\n```\nWinter:\n  Christmas: Lights, Wreath\n  New Years: Party Hats\n```\n\n* Write a method to collect all holidays with \"BBQ\" in the supply array. The method should behave as seen below:\n\n```bash\nholidays_with_bbqs(holiday_supplies)\n#=> [:fourth_of_july, :memorial_day]\n```\n\n**Reminder:** This is a challenging lab, so remember to use Pry, Google, and the Flatiron School community to help you get the tests passing.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [StackOverflow: Accessing Elements of Nested Hashes in Ruby](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5544858/accessing-elements-of-nested-hashes-in-ruby)\n- [honeybadger - Advanced Ruby Hash Techniques](http://blog.honeybadger.io/advanced-ruby-hash-techniques/)\n\n\n<p data-visibility='hidden'>View <a href='https://learn.co/lessons/apples-and-holidays' title='Iterating Over Hashes'>Iterating Over Hashes</a> on Learn.co and start learning to code for free.</p>\n"

  "readme_contents": "# VirtualBuddy\n\nVirtualBuddy can virtualize macOS 12 and later on Apple Silicon, with the goal of offering features that are useful to developers who need to test their apps on multiple versions of macOS, especially betas.\n\n**Requires macOS 12.3 and an Apple Silicon Mac**\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f WARNING: This project is experimental. Things might break or not work as expected.\n\n[Download from GitHub Releases](https://github.com/insidegui/VirtualBuddy/releases)\n\n![](./Screenshot.png)\n\n### Feature Checklist\n\n- [x] Ability to boot any version of macOS 12 or macOS 13, including betas\n- [x] Built-in installation wizard\n\t- [x] Select from a collection of restore images available on Apple's servers\n\t- [x] Install the latest stable version of macOS\n\t- [x] Local restore image IPSW file\n\t- [x] Custom restore image URL\n- [x] Boot into recovery mode (in order to disable SIP, for example)\n- [x] Networking and file sharing support\n- [x] Clipboard sharing (without the need to be running macOS Ventura) (experimental \u00b9)\n- [ ] Edit NVRAM variables\n- [ ] Customize virtual machine hardware configuration\n\n_\u00b9 To enable clipboard sharing, build the `VirtualBuddyGuest` scheme, then copy the `VirtualBuddyGuest` app to the virtual machine (through file sharing, for example) and run it. This will keep the clipboard in sync between the guest and host machines. The feature is experimental, so it might be buggy and it's definitely not secure._\n\n### Tips and Tricks\n\n#### Taking Advantage of APFS\n\nSometimes when trying things out in the OS installed in one of the virtual machines, things might break, requiring a full install of the guest operating system again, which is a pain.\n\nThanks to APFS cloning though, you can just duplicate a virtual machine within your library folder (using Command + D in Finder), and the copy will take almost no additional disk space. This way you can have a \"clean\" copy of your VM, do whatever you want with a duplicate of it, and then throw the copy away and re-duplicate the clean version if things break.\n\n#### Screen Resolution\n\nVirtualBuddy sets up its virtual machines to have the same screen resolution as the host's main screen. This is great if you want to use the VM in full screen and take advantage of the entire resolution of your Mac's display.\n\nThe default mode the VM OS selects for the display uses the native resolution that's available to it though, which can make things look really small. In order to address this, go into System Preferences > Displays within the guest operating system and choose a scaled resolution.\n\n## Building\n\nXcode 14 is recommended.\n\n- Open the `VirtualBuddy/Config/Signing.xcconfig` file\n- Set the `VB_BUNDLE_ID_PREFIX` variable to something unique like `com.yourname.`\n- Select the VirtualBuddy project in the Xcode sidebar\n- Under \"Targets\", select \"VirtualBuddy\"\n- Go to the Signing & Capabilities tab and select your development team under Signing > Team\n- Repeat the same process for the \"VirtualBuddyGuest\" target\n- Build the `VirtualBuddy` scheme"

The current supported version is indicated on the React Native badge at the top of this README.  If it's out of date, we encourage you to submit a pull request!\n\n## Usage\n### Linking the Library\nIn order to use Safari View, you must first link the library your project.  There's excellent documentation on how to do this in the [React Native Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html#content).\n\n### Displaying the Safari View\nOnce you've linked the library, you'll want to make it available to your app by requiring it:\n\n```js\nvar SafariView = require('react-native-safari-view');\n```\n\nDisplaying the Safari View is as simple as calling:\n```js\nSafariView.show({\n  url: 'https://github.com/naoufal'\n});\n```\n\n### URL Change Notifications\nThere isn't an API for retrieving URL changes provided by SFSafariViewController or its delegate in iOS, so there's no way to know where the user is navigating to. However, it is possible to get a notification when the Safari View navigates to an URL scheme specified by your app (e.g. `your-app-name://`). This is especially useful for implementing callback oriented flows such as in OAuth2 / OpenID Connect. \n\nTo get URL notifications for your URL scheme you'll need to:\n 1. Register an [URL scheme](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/Inter-AppCommunication/Inter-AppCommunication.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH6-SW10) in your Xcode Project\n 2. Make sure you've set up [Linking](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking.html) in your react-native project.\n 3. Listen for URL changes in your react-native code (i.e. `Linking.addEventListener('url', eventHandler)`);\n \n\n## Example\nUsing Safari View in your app will usually look like this:\n```js\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport SafariView from \"react-native-safari-view\";\n\nclass YourComponent extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n\n  _pressHandler() {\n    SafariView.isAvailable()\n      .then(SafariView.show({\n        url: \"https://github.com/naoufal\"\n      }))\n      .catch(error => {\n        // Fallback WebView code for iOS 8 and earlier\n      });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <View>\n        ...\n        <Button onPress={this._pressHandler}>\n          Show Safari View\n        </Button>\n      </View>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Methods\n\n### show(safariOptions)\nDisplays a Safari View with the provided url.\n\n__Arguments__\n- `safariOptions` - An `Object` containing a `url` key and optionally a `readerMode` key, a `tintColor`, and/or a `barTintColor`.\n\n__safariOptions__\n- `url` - A `String` containing the url you want to load in the Safari View\n- `readerMode` - A `Boolean` indicating to use Safari's Reader Mode if available\n- `tintColor` - A `String` containing a hex, rgba or rgba color to use for the browser controls\n- `barTintColor` - A `String` containing a hex, rgba or rgba color to use for the background of the browser controls (only available on iOS 10 and higher)\n- `fromBottom` - A 'Boolean' indicating to open the Safari View from the bottom\n\n__Examples__\n```js\nSafariView.show({\n  url: \"http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/26/introducing-react-native.html\",\n  readerMode: true // optional,\n  tintColor: \"#000\" // optional\n  barTintColor: \"#fff\" // optional\n});\n```\n\n### isAvailable()\nChecks if Safari View is available on the device.\n\n__Example__\n```js\nSafariView.isAvailable()\n  .then(available => {\n    console.log(\"SafariView is available.\");\n  })\n  .catch(error => {\n    console.log(error);\n  });\n```\n\n### dismiss()\nDismisses the currently active Safari View.\n\n__Example__\n```js\nSafariView.dismiss()\n```\n\n## Events\nThe following events are fired by the Safari View.\n\n### onShow\n__Example__\n```js\nlet showSubscription = SafariView.addEventListener(\n  \"onShow\",\n  () => {\n    StatusBar.setBarStyle(\"light-content\");\n  }\n);\n```\n\n### onDismiss\n__Example__\n```js\nlet dismissSubscription = SafariView.addEventListener(\n  \"onDismiss\",\n  () => {\n    StatusBar.setBarStyle(\"default\");\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2015, [Naoufal Kadhom](http://naoufal.com)\n\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.

You need to create a new connection to APNS to see all the tokens that have failed since you only receive that information upon connection. Remember, once you have viewed the list of tokens, Apple will clear the list from their servers. Use the timestamp to verify that the device tokens haven\u2019t been reregistered since the feedback entry was generated. For each device that has not been reregistered, stop sending notifications. By using this information to stop sending push notifications that will fail to be delivered, you reduce unnecessary message overhead and improve overall system performance.\n\n```\n#New APNS connection\nfeedback_connection = APNs(use_sandbox=True, cert_file='cert.pem', key_file='key.pem')\n\n# Get feedback messages.\nfor (token_hex, fail_time) in feedback_connection.feedback_server.items():\n    # do stuff with token_hex and fail_time\n```\n\n\nFor more complicated alerts including custom buttons etc, use the PayloadAlert \nclass. Example:\n\n```python\nalert = PayloadAlert(\"Hello world!\", action_loc_key=\"Click me\")\npayload = Payload(alert=alert, sound=\"default\")\n```\n\nTo send custom payload arguments, pass a dictionary to the custom kwarg\nof the Payload constructor.\n\n```python\npayload = Payload(alert=\"Hello World!\", custom={'sekrit_number':123})\n```\n\n### Enhanced Message with immediate error-response\n```python\napns_enhanced = APNs(use_sandbox=True, cert_file='apns.pem', enhanced=True)\n```\n\nSend a notification. note that `identifer` is the information to indicate which message has error in error-response payload, it should be **UNIQUE** since PyAPNs will also use it to determine the range of messages to be re-sent.\n```python\ntoken_hex = 'b5bb9d8014a0f9b1d61e21e796d78dccdf1352f23cd32812f4850b87'\npayload = Payload(alert=\"Hello World!\", sound=\"default\", badge=1)\nidentifier = random.getrandbits(32)\napns_enhanced.gateway_server.send_notification(token_hex, payload, identifier=identifier)\n```\n\nCallback when error-response occur, with parameter `{'status': <status code from APNS>, 'identifier': <the identifier specified>}`\n[Status code reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/CommunicatingWIthAPS.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH101-SW4)\n```python\ndef response_listener(error_response):\n    _logger.debug(\"client get error-response: \" + str(error_response))\n\napns_enhanced.gateway_server.register_response_listener(response_listener)\n```\n\nError response worker will be auto-close after 30 secs idle of connection operations.\nIf you want disable APNS connection and error-responses handler immediately, force_close it.\n```python\napns_enhanced.gateway_server.force_close()\n```\n\nExtra log messages when error-response occur, auto-resent afterwards.\n\n    got error-response from APNS:(8, 1)\n    rebuilding connection to APNS\n    resending 9 notifications to APNS\n    resending notification with id:2 to APNS\n    resending notification with id:3 to APNS\n    resending notification with id:4 to APNS\n\nCaveats:\n\n* Currently support single notification only\n\nProblem Addressed ([Reference to Redth](http://redth.codes/the-problem-with-apples-push-notification-ser/)):\n\n* Async response of error response and response time varies from 0.1 ~ 0.8 secs by observation\n* Sent success do not response, which means client cannot always expect for response.\n* Async close write stream connection after error-response.\n* All notification sent after failed notification are discarded, the responding error-response and closing client's write connection will be delayed\n* Sometimes APNS close socket connection arbitrary\n\nSolution:\n\n* Non-blocking ssl socket connection to send notification without waiting for response.\n* A separate thread for constantly checking error-response from read connection.\n* A sent notification buffer used for re-sending notification that were sent after failed notification, or arbitrary connection close by apns.\n* Reference to [non-blocking apns pull request by minorblend](https://github.com/djacobs/PyAPNs/pull/25), [enhanced message by hagino3000](https://github.com/voyagegroup/apns-proxy-server/blob/065775f87dbf25f6b06f24edc73dc5de4481ad36/apns_proxy_server/worker.py#l164-209)\n\nResult:\n\n* Send notification at throughput of 1000/secs\n* In worse case of when 1st notification sent failed, error-response respond after 1 secs and 999 notification sent are discarded by APNS at the mean time, all discarded 999 notifications will be resent without loosing any of them. With the same logic, if notification resent failed, it will resent rest of resent notification after the failed one.\n\n## Test ##\n* [Test Script](https://gist.github.com/jimhorng/594401f68ce48282ced5)\n\n## Travis Build Status\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/djacobs/PyAPNs.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/djacobs/PyAPNs)\n\n## Further Info\n\n[iOS Reference Library: Local and Push Notification Programming Guide][a1]\n\n## License\n\nPyAPNs is distributed under the terms of the MIT license.\n\nSee [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for the complete license details.\n\n## Credits\n\nWritten and maintained by Simon Whitaker at [Goo Software Ltd][goo].\n\n[a1]:https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH3-SW1\n[goo]:http://www.goosoftware.co.uk/\n"

Some are great as standalone scripts while others are great for incorporation with others.\n\n> This repo is in continuous development and will be updated as scripts are developed (and as I have time).\n\n<!--<details>\n  <summary><strong>Table of Contents</strong> (click to expand)</summary> -->\n\n<!-- TOC depthFrom:2 -->\n\n- [My AppleScripts](#my-applescripts)\n  - [About](#about)\n  - [Contents](#contents)\n    - [Application Scripts](#application-scripts)\n    - [Global Scripts](#global-scripts)\n    - [Scripts for Script Development](#scripts-for-script-development)\n    - [Icon Key](#icon-key)\n    - [Shortcut key symbols](#shortcut-key-symbols)\n  - [Tools](#tools)\n  - [Tips](#tips)\n    - [Keep Scripts In Sync Using Aliases](#keep-scripts-in-sync-using-aliases)\n    - [Make a Hyperkey](#make-a-hyperkey)\n  - [Resources](#resources)\n    - [My Favorite AppleScripters](#my-favorite-applescripters)\n    - [My Favorite Tutorials](#my-favorite-tutorials)\n  - [Licensing & thanks](#licensing--thanks)\n  - [To-Do](#to-do)\n\n<!-- /TOC -->\n<!-- </details> -->\n\n<a id=\"about\"></a>\n\n## About\n\nThis repo was created for two main reasons.\n\n1. Provide others with useful scripts for automating their workflow on macOS.\n2. As a tool for AppleScript education by providing example scripts, tools, tips and AppleScript resources.\n\nWith some exceptions, almost all these scripts are executable by themselves via the [Script Menu][klsie781]. However, I generally turn to third party automation apps to execute them, including [Keyboard Maestro][kmapp], [Alfred][alfredapp], [BetterTouchTool][bttapp] and [Hazel][hazelapp].\n\n- **Notes on formatting**\nFor those who are unaware, the standard file format for AppleScripts is `.scpt` or `.scptd`, but these file types are not readable on GitHub, so for readability's sake, all these scripts have been exported as a `.applescript` file (which is just a text file). So if you were wondering about the file type, this is the reason.\n\n- Many of these scripts depend on this [script library][kevinslib] I developed, so if you see the following line at the top of the script, make sure you get that library and place it into `~/Library/Script Libraries` otherwise the script is non-functional.\n\n```AppleScript\nuse kl : script \"Kevin's Library\"\n```\n\n## Contents\n\nI've divided the scripts into 3 sections:\n\n1. **Application Scripts** - Scripts designed for use in a specific application.\n2. **Global Scripts** - Scripts that are meant to be executed in any application.\n    - _NOTE_: There are scripts here that are specific to an application but are meant to executed globally, so the scripts in the Application Scripts section with the globe icon ( :earth_americas: ) next to them imply global scope for that specific application.\n3. **Scripts for Script Development** - These scripts are useful handlers that can be copied into scripts or into a script library that makes scripting much simpler.\n\nClicking the name of the script will show you the script directly, but **make sure to view the README for each section** by clicking the title of the section to see instructions/explanations/demos.\n\n> Although not needed, the shortcut keys I use to execute these via [Keyboard Maestro][kmapp] or [Alfred][alfredapp] are included in case your're interested\n\n### Application Scripts\n\n| Application                | Scripts                                           | <i></i>                   | Shortcut Key

When I first started learning scripting with Script Editor, the process was slow and frustrating. With Script Debugger I learned 100 times faster and understood everything much easier.\n- **[UI Browser][733e1356]** - Invaluable tool for UI scripting. UI scripting is brutal on its own, and slightly less brutal with the Accessibility Inspector, but UI Browser makes it so much simpler, I tried it once and knew I had to get it.\n- **[JSON Helper][vb5342sx]** - Makes working with JSON so much simpler, incredibly useful and **free**!\n- **[Location Helper][f83kch8s]** - Find your geo code location in a snap, and for **free**!\n- **[Dash][ba330e94]** - Fantastic tool for API browsing, after installation go to `Preferences` > `Downloads` and install the AppleScript docset to have blazing fast access to AppleScript documentation, plus its **free**!\n- **IDE Extensions** (I do all my script writing in Script Debugger but most of my Markdown stuff in [VS Code][jsla8872] or [Atom][[23ce9ea9]] or so these are very useful.)\n  - VSCode Extensions:\n    - [AppleScript][038e5f13] - allows AppleScript syntax and the ability to build and run AppleScripts.\n  - Atom Packages\n    - [atom-applescript][ebc1bce1] - adds language support to Atom so you can view AppleScript syntax\n    - [build-osa][81efcc24] - Lets you build and execute AppleScripts from Atom.\n- **[Alfred Workflows][alfredapp]**\n  - [AppScripts][7059c39d] - List, search and run/open AppleScripts for the active application\n  - [KeyCodes][f4cf643d] - Great for UI scripting where you need to type a non-character key. Lets you find AppleScript key codes in an instant by typing `kc [<key name>]`.\n    - If you don't have Alfred then bookmark [Complete list of AppleScript key codes][84203753]\n- **[Keycue][3383effc]** - I use this more for Keyboard Maestro, but it's a great app for quickly looking up keyboard shortcuts for macros or menu items.\n\n[b7d3d0a1]: https://latenightsw.com/\n[d9ca98d8]: https://pfiddlesoft.com/uibrowser/\n[ba330e94]: https://kapeli.com/dash\n[jsla8872]: https://code.visualstudio.com/\n[23ce9ea9]: https://atom.io/\n[038e5f13]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=idleberg.applescript\n[ebc1bce1]: https://github.com/franzheidl/atom-applescript\n[81efcc24]: https://github.com/idleberg/atom-build-osa\n[7059c39d]: https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-appscripts\n[f4cf643d]: http://www.packal.org/workflow/keycodes\n[84203753]: https://eastmanreference.com/complete-list-of-applescript-key-codes\n[3383effc]: https://www.ergonis.com/products/keycue/\n\n* * *\n\n## Tips\n\n### Keep Scripts In Sync Using Aliases\n\nIn order for scripts to be accessible via the Script Menu, scripts must be stored in `~/Library/Scripts`, but if you like to keep your scripts synced between devices, this location is a pain. I used to have a [Hazel][hazelapp] rule set up to sync `~/Library/Scripts` to Dropbox that worked fine for years, but I didn't like all the extra processing needed to sync and worse yet I had 2 copies of every script which was messy and got confusing.\n\nI realized later that moving all my scripts to `~/Dropbox/Library/Scripts` then creating an alias to that location and moving it `~/Library` allows for my scripts to be stored in Dropbox, and still be accessible in the Script Menu!\n> This method works exactly as well with the `~/Library/Script Libraries` folder.\n\nHere's a screenshot of what it looks like in Finder.\n\n![aliasDemo](./imgs/aliasPath.png)\n\n**How to do it:**\n\n1. **Make a backup** of the folder your moving to your Desktop just in case you mess up.\n2. I recommend having the same folder structure in Dropbox so make the folder `~/Dropbox/Library/`\n3. Copy the folder you want to sync (`~/Library/Scripts/` or `~/Library/Script Libraries/`) and paste into the `~/Dropbox/Library/` folder you made.\n4. Delete the original folder you copied from `~/Library/`\n5. Select the folder you pasted into `~/Dropbox/Library/` then click `File` > `Make Alias`\n6. Move the resulting alias back to `~/Library/`. The result will be like `~/Library/Scripts alias` so rename the alias by removing the \" alias\" part so it looks like `~/Library/Scripts` and you're good to go!\n\n- **NOTE**: Symlinks don't work for this method, I originally tried the following command which did make an alias, but then the scripts weren't accessible via the Script Menu.\n\n    ```shell\n    ln -s ~/Library/Scripts ~/Dropbox/Library/Scripts/\n    ```\n\n### Make a Hyperkey\n\nThe <kbd>caps lock</kbd> key is a borderline useless key for a decent typist, but what's great about Macs is that we can change that. By a few adjustments in `System Preferences` and installing the free software [Karabiner][0896dcbc], we can turn that useless key into a extremely useful <kbd>hyperkey</kbd>.\n\nHyperkey just means that the <kbd>caps lock</kbd> key will emulate holding down <kbd>\u2318</kbd><kbd>\u2303</kbd><kbd>\u2325</kbd><kbd>\u21e7</kbd> at the same time, and since no application would use such a combination of keys to execute a command, this makes a whole new modifier key for us to implement.\n\n**How to do it:**\n\n1. Download [Karabiner][0896dcbc]\n2. Go to `System Preferences` > `Keyboard` and click on `Modifier Keys...` and make it look like this\n![keyboardprefs](./imgs/karabiner-keyboard-prefs.png)\n3. Launch the `Karabiner-Elements` app\n4. Click the `Complex Modifications` button and click the `Add Rule` button to install the hyperkey mod. You can see the mods I use below.\n\n![karabinerMods](./imgs/karabiner-mods.png)\n\nAnd that's it!

  "readme_contents": "# Spotify to Apple Music\nSome simple Python 3 scripts to help you into importing your existing Spotify library into Apple Music.  \n**Work in progress !**\n\n## Usage\n\n### 1. Export the Spotify songs to an CSV File\nThe first step is getting the songs you want to import into Apple Music into a CSV file. The simplest way to do this is using [Exportify](https://rawgit.com/watsonbox/exportify/master/exportify.html).  \nIf you want to export you whole Spotify library, simply create a new playlist called *All* and drag your whole library into it using the Spotify desktop app. You can then export the playlist *All* using *Exportify*. Save the resulting file as *spotify.csv* in the same directory as the directory you cloned this repo into.\n\n### 2. Match the Spotify songs with their Apple Music identifier\nIn order to add songs to our Apple Music library, we need their Apple Music identifier. Running `python3 retrieve-identifiers.py` will use the *spotify.csv* file to create a new file *itunes.csv* with each line consisting of the Apple Music identifier of a song in your Spotify library.\n\n### 3. Use an intercepting proxy to retrieve the Apple Music request headers\nStart iTunes and [Charles](http://www.charlesproxy.com) (or another intercepting proxy you like). Make sure SSL Proxying is enabled and working correctly. Next, select a random song on Apple Music you don't have in your library yet, right click and choose 'Add to library'. If everything went well, you're now able to view all the request headers in Charles of a request to `https://ld-4.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZDaap.woa/daap/databases/1/cloud-add`. We're only interested in `Cookie`, `X-Dsid` and `X-Guid`. Copy the value of these header and paste them in the appropriate place  in `insert-songs.py` (line 29 and further).  \nNext, run `python3 insert-songs.py` and go grab a coffee. You're songs are now being imported into Apple Music.\n\n\n## Current issues\n\n### API limit rate\nApple Music doesn't like it when we're adding a lot of songs in a small amount of time. If we do so, the API responds to all further request with `403 Too many requests`. After this, you're blocked from the API for an undetermined amount of time. We're currently trying to avoid this by waiting after each request. A delay of 30 seconds seems fine to import large libraries into Apple Music. If you're library is smaller, feel free to decrease the delay in `inserts-songs.py`.\n\n### Missing songs\nThe script I'm using to retrieve the Apple Music identifier for a Spotify song is quite basic. It simply compares the title and artist to find out if a Spotify and Apple Music song match. Some songs don't have the exact same title (extraneous spacing for example) in both services. This results in the script failing to retrieve an identifier for some songs.\n\n### Terminal encoding\nSome users are reporting errors like `UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\\xd8' in ...` when running the scripts. The problem here is that Python is trying to convert UTF-8 characters to ASCII to print them to standard output. This can be solved by setting the `PYTHONIOENCODING` environment variable to `utf-8`.  \nIn Bash, simply call the scripts like this: `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python3 retrieve-identifiers.py` and `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python3 insert-songs.Py`\n"

  "readme_contents": "ATTENTION: THIS LIBRARY IS NOW OBSOLETE / DEPRECATED!\n=====================================================\nI've recently started a new project called [PushSharp](https://github.com/Redth/PushSharp/).  Its goal is to combine APNS-Sharp as well as C2DM-Sharp into a single project.  It takes some of the same great code from APNS-Sharp, and still allows you to easily send push notifications, but it also includes an optional abstraction layer for sending notifications to multiple platforms.  Please go check it out.  Once PushSharp is a bit more mature, this project will be deprecated.  For now I will not be adding any major new functionality to this library.  \n\nSo go check out [PushSharp](https://github.com/Redth/PushSharp/)!  It's open source (under Apache 2.0), and a solid step forward for push notifications!\n\n(https://github.com/Redth/PushSharp/)\n\n\n\nApple Push Notification & Feedback Services Client C# Library\n=============================================================\n\nA free, open source, independent and mono compatible C#/.NET Library for interacting with Apple's Push Notification & Feedback Services for the iPhone/iPod.\n\n##News\n + **May 9, 2011** Moved project to Github!\n + **March 27, 2010** Updated to 1.0.3.0 with a couple bug fixes\n + **January 18, 2010** Added a very simple sample solution for MonoTouch that shows how implement Push Notifications in a MonoTouch? application\n + **December 22, 2009** [Apns-Sharp now Powering G-Push Mail](http://redth.info/2009/12/22/apns-sharp-updated-and-now-powering-g-push-mail/) (New Version: 1.0.2.0)\n\n##Features\n + Push Notifications Client\n + Feedback Service Client\n + iTunes Receipt Verification Client\n\n##Details\nThis is a pretty simplistic library, but it should give all C# developers a jump start into developing for Apple's Push Notifications platform. Feel free to use it as needed.\n\nOne of the goals was to make this mono compatible, since I needed it myself to run on Debian/Mono 2.4 on Amazon's EC2 Platform. This works great on mono 2.4, I have not tested it on anything below 2.4.\n\nI have also included a simple iTunes/AppStore Receipt Verification Library that simplifies the process for verifying the receipt data from In-App Purchases.\n\n##Testing\nThe code for the Apns Notifications is fairly well tested and currently in use in a production app. The code for the Feedback service should be ok, however I'm working on integrating it into my production app at this point. The AppStore? code is the least tested of all, please report any bugs you run into with this!\n\nI would encourage you to checkout the source and use that! Please use this project page's issue tracker to send me bugs, and I will fix them!\n\n##Contributing\nIf you have improvements to my code, by all means let me know. If you'd like to become a contributer to the project, I'd be happy to make that happen too!\n\n##License\nThis code is licensed under the MIT License.

  "readme_contents": "# Apple IIe Mini powered by C.H.I.P\nHere you will find everything you need to create your very own C.H.I.P. powered Apple IIe Mini computer.\n\n![Finished Build](./BuildImages/BuildImage3.jpg)\n\n# How it works\nThis Apple IIe mini is completely self contained and has a battery life of about 10 hours give or take.  I haven't actually tested it, so I'm guessing based on the stated life of the battery and the amount of currrent draw observed during testing.\n\nThe C.H.I.P. can use 3.3V to 5V power, however the LCD TFT screen requires 6V to 12V.  I solved this by using a 12V drone/RC battery and passed it through a cheap 5V buck converter to power the C.H.I.P.  I created a very simple PCB to accomplish this.  You do not need the PCB to complete this build, I created one just to keep things a bit tidy.\n\nYou can of course use a super cheap linear regular like an LM317 to do the same job, but the $5 buck converter is much more efficient and will extend the battery life.\n\nA stock C.H.I.P is all you need, I could not get the emulator to run in headless mode, so you will need the standard firmware and then configure the emulator to auto run in the KDE desktop.\n\n# Tools Required\n- Soldering Iron\n- Edge cutters (To cut off excess pins after soldering)\n- Good 60/40 Solder\n- 22 Guage or similar stranded hook up wire\n\n# Electrical Components Required\nIf you are building it the exact same way I did, including the PCB this is what you will need\n- 4x JS 2.0 PH Connectors Male & Female (For 12V In, 12V Out, Speaker Out, and Power Switch)\n- 2x 40 Pin DIP headers\n- 1x 4 pin 12v to 5v buck converter (Search EBay)\n- 1x Small speaker (Digikey SP-1504 is what I used)\n- 1x Lumineer 1300mAh 12V battery\n- 1x Set of XT60 Drone battery connectors\n- 1x 3S LiPo battery charger (Optional, but I'm sure you will want to charge the battery at some point)\n- 1x 3.5\" TFT LCD TV from Adafruit (https://www.adafruit.com/products/913)\n- 1x Pushbutton toggle switch for power (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1683)\n\n# 3D Prints\nI used the excellent 3D models from Thingiverse of a user named option8 and printed them on my Zortrax M200 pinter at 0.19mm/Medium infill.  The original models are meant for a Raspberry Pi powered via USB, so I modified the base a bit for this self contained model.\n- Apple II Enclosure (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:340677)\n- Apple II Monitor (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:377253)\n- Apple II Enclosed Base (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2103158)\n\nI drilled a hole through the top of the enclosure into the monitor to run the wires for the monitor power, power switch, and video signals into the monitor.\n\nStandard super glue seemed to work fine for gluing everything together.\n\n# Paint\nI followed option8's directions for painting with the following spray paints\n- Montana GOLD (Sahara Yellow) for case\n- Krylon Espresso for Keyboard/Accessories\n\n# Video Signal\nUnfortunately the composite video signal from the C.H.I.P. is not exposed on the pin headers, so I was forced to hack it in.  If you are able to find a small enough right angle 3.5mm to RCA video cable that works go for it.  I was not.\n\nTo hack in the video signal, simply attach a wire from the video signal on the C.H.I.P. PCB.  I have highlighted the correct pin here: [Video Pin](./BuildImages/VideoPin.png)\n\nConnect the video GND to any available ground, I soldered it directly to the top of the 3.5mm connector on the C.H.I.P.\n\n# Emulator\nI am using a slightly modified version of LinApple-Pie which you can get here https://github.com/Cupcakus/linapple-pie\n\nI have modified the original emulator a bit to make the menus more readable on the 320x240 screen.\n"

  "readme_contents": "## INTRODUCTION\n\nInspect Apple macOS software updates.\n\n![SUS Inspector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hjuutilainen/sus-inspector/master/screenshot.png)\n\nSUS Inspector is an utility app for viewing detailed information about Apple's Software Update Service. It sets up a local [Reposado](https://github.com/wdas/reposado) installation to replicate catalogs and then parses them for viewing.\n\nBy default, SUS Inspector uses Apple's servers for the catalogs. If you are already replicating the software update service on your local network (using Reposado, OS X Server or something else) you should point SUS Inspector to that local server instead. This will greatly speed up the sync process.\n\nTo do this, modify the base URL before launching SUS Inspector for the first time:\n\n    $ defaults write com.hjuutilainen.SUS-Inspector baseURL \"https://reposado.example.com\"\n\nOr edit the URL's manually on the first run setup window.\n\n\n### KNOWN ISSUES\n\n* There's no way to cancel an active package download.\n* There's no way to cancel an active repo_sync.\n* The 'Extract Package Payload...' from product info window works only for newer gzip compressed payloads.\n* Catalogs can't be modified after the initial setup.\n* Preferences need major UI work\n\n\n### RESETTING AND UNINSTALLING\n\nRemoving SUS Inspector's database file effectively resets the application and causes the first run setup window to reappear. This database file is in SQLite format and can be found in:\n\n    ~/Library/Application Support/SUS Inspector/SUS_Inspector.storedata\n\nBy default, all Reposado generated data is kept separate from the application and the default location is in:\n\n    ~/Library/Application Support/SUS Inspector/Default/\n\nCompletely removing SUS Inspector and Reposado data can be done by removing the whole SUS Inspector directory:\n\n    ~/Library/Application Support/SUS Inspector/\n\n\n## REQUIREMENTS\n\nSUS Inspector requires macOS 10.13 or later.\n\n\n## INSTALLATION\n\nThe current release version can be downloaded from the [Releases page](https://github.com/hjuutilainen/sus-inspector/releases)\n\nThe other way to run SUS Inspector is to build from source:\n\n1. Clone the project (including the Reposado submodule)\n\n        $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/hjuutilainen/sus-inspector.git\n\n2. Open \"SUS Inspector.xcodeproj\" with Xcode and hit 'Run'\n\n\nBuilding requires:\n\n* Xcode\n* Optional: [mogenerator + Xmo'd](http://github.com/rentzsch/mogenerator) \n\n\n## THANKS\n\n* Greg Neagle for his [Reposado](https://github.com/wdas/reposado)\n* Jonathan Rentzsch for his [mogenerator](http://github.com/rentzsch/mogenerator)\n* CocoaDev [MultiPanePreferences](http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?MultiPanePreferences)\n* Cathy Shive for [NSCell example code](http://katidev.com/blog/2008/02/22/styling-an-nstableview-dttah/)\n* Daniel Jalkut at Red Sweater Software for [RSVerticallyCenteredTextFieldCell](http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/148/what-a-difference-a-cell-makes)\n* SUS Inspector uses wonderful icons created by:\n    * [Glyphish Pro 3](http://www.glyphish.com)\n    * [Batch](http://adamwhitcroft.com/batch/) by [@adamwhitcroft](https://twitter.com/adamwhitcroft)\n\n\n## LICENSE\n\nSUS Inspector itself is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. The included [Reposado](https://github.com/wdas/reposado) is licensed under the new BSD license.\n\n\n## DONATIONS\n\nThere's no need to donate, the app is free to use and I'm just happy it's useful to other admins. If you absolutely want to support the development of these tools, you should first go and see a Disney movie of your choice (because Reposado and Munki are open source projects from Walt Disney Animation Studios and my projects simply wouldn't exist without those projects). After that, if you're still up for it, you can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/hjuutilainen).\n"

To run the example:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/mtford90/react-native-watch-connectivity.git\ncd react-native-watch-connectivity/example\nyarn install\ncd ios\npod install\ncd ..\nyarn ios # Run app\nopen ios/RNWatchExample.xcworkspace # Run watch app from Xcode\n```\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install react-native-watch-connectivity --save\n# or\nyarn add react-native-watch-connectivity\n```\n\n### Link\n\nNote: this library now supports autolinking for RN 0.60+.\n\nFor RN <0.60 link via:\n\n```bash\nreact-native link\n```\n\nOr else add the xcodeproj or .h/.m files directly to your project via XCode\n\n#### Manual Linking\n\nOr you can link the library manually by adding `node_modules/react-native-watch-connectivity/ios/RNWatch.xcodeproj` to your project and ensuring that `libRNWatch.a` is present in the **Link Binary With Libraries** build phase.\n\nAlternatively, if you're using CocoaPods, you can add the following to your Podfile:\n\n```\npod 'RNWatch', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-watch-connectivity'\n```\n\nand run `pod install`.\n\n### Expo Support\n\nThis library has been successfully used in Expo apps (Bare Workflow with EAS Build).\n"

Install the react-native-health package from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-health)\n\n```\nyarn add react-native-health\n```\n\n2. If you are using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) you can run the following\n   from the `ios/` folder of your app\n\n```\npod install\n```\n\nOr, if you need to manually link it, run\n\n```\nreact-native link react-native-health\n```\n\n3. Update the `ios/<Project Name>/info.plist` file in your project\n\n```\n<key>NSHealthShareUsageDescription</key>\n<string>Read and understand health data.</string>\n<key>NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription</key>\n<string>Share workout data with other apps.</string>\n<!-- Below is only required if requesting clinical health data -->\n<key>NSHealthClinicalHealthRecordsShareUsageDescription</key>\n<string>Read and understand clinical health data.</string>\n```\n\nTo add Healthkit support to your application's `Capabilities`\n\n- Open the `ios/` folder of your project in Xcode\n- Select the project name in the left sidebar\n- In the main view select '+ Capability' and double click 'HealthKit'\n\nTo enable access to clinical data types, check the `Clinical Health Records` box.\n\n## Usage\n\nIn order to start collecting or saving data to HealthKit, you need to request\nthe user's permissions for the given data types. It can be done in the following\nway\n\n```typescript\nimport AppleHealthKit, {\n  HealthValue,\n  HealthKitPermissions,\n} from 'react-native-health'\n\n/* Permission options */\nconst permissions = {\n  permissions: {\n    read: [AppleHealthKit.Constants.Permissions.HeartRate],\n    write: [AppleHealthKit.Constants.Permissions.Steps],\n  },\n} as HealthKitPermissions\n\nAppleHealthKit.initHealthKit(permissions, (error: string) => {\n  /* Called after we receive a response from the system */\n\n  if (error) {\n    console.log('[ERROR] Cannot grant permissions!')\n  }\n\n  /* Can now read or write to HealthKit */\n\n  const options = {\n    startDate: new Date(2020, 1, 1).toISOString(),\n  }\n\n  AppleHealthKit.getHeartRateSamples(\n    options,\n    (callbackError: string, results: HealthValue[]) => {\n      /* Samples are now collected from HealthKit */\n    },\n  )\n})\n```\n\n### Background Processing\n\nFor background capabilities, Apple allows developers to setup long running observer\nqueries for the health types needed.\n\nTo setup that in your app, in XCode open your `ios/AppDelegate.m` file and add the\nfollowing statements:\n\n```objective-c\n#import \"AppDelegate.h\"\n\n...\n\n/* Add the library import at the top of AppDelegate.m */\n#import \"RCTAppleHealthKit.h\"\n\n...\n\n@implementation AppDelegate\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application\n    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n\n  RCTBridge *bridge = [[RCTBridge alloc] initWithDelegate:self\n                                            launchOptions:launchOptions];\n\n  ...\n\n  /* Add Background initializer for HealthKit  */\n  [[RCTAppleHealthKit new] initializeBackgroundObservers:bridge];\n\n  ...\n\n  return YES;\n}\n```\n\nAfter that you can start listening for data updates using the React Native\nclient.

If\nan authorization error occurs, you can prompt the user to set the\nspecific permission or add the permission to the options object when\ninitializing the library.\n\nIf extra read or write permissions are added to the options object, the\napp will request for user's permission to them when the library is\ninitialized again.\n\n### Manual Installation\n\n1. Run `yarn add react-native-health`\n2. In XCode, in the project navigator, right-click `Libraries` \u279c `Add Files to [your project's name]`\n3. Go to `node_modules` \u279c `react-native-health` and add `RCTAppleHealthkit.xcodeproj`\n4. In XCode, in the project navigator, select your project. Add `libRCTAppleHealthkit.a`\n   to your project's `Build Phases` \u279c `Link Binary With Libraries`\n5. Click `RCTAppleHealthkit.xcodeproj` in the project navigator and go\n   the `Build Settings` tab. Make sure 'All' is toggled on (instead of 'Basic').\n   In the `Search Paths` section, look for `Header Search Paths` and make sure\n   it contains both `$(SRCROOT)/../../react-native/React`\n   and `$(SRCROOT)/../../../React` - mark both as `recursive`.\n6. Enable Healthkit in your application's `Capabilities`\n   ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ql1kXCg.png 'Xcode Capabilities Section')\n7. Compile and run\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe appreciate any additional request and/or contribution to `react-native-health`.\nThe [issues](https://github.com/agencyenterprise/react-native-health/issues) tracker\nis used to keep a list of features and bugs to be worked on. Please see our\n[contributing documentation](https://github.com/agencyenterprise/react-native-health/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nfor some tips on getting started.\n\n## References\n\n- [Apple Healthkit Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit)\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\n> _This package is a fork of [rn-apple-healthkit](https://github.com/terrillo/rn-apple-healthkit)_\n\n> _This package also inherits additional features from [Nutrisense](https://www.nutrisense.io/) fork_\n"

Target is JavaCard 2.2.2+, with 1-3k of transient memory.\n\n## Current status\n\nWhat works:\n\n * OpenSC, MacOS (`piv.tokend` for login), Windows PIV\n * RSA-1024 and -2048 key generation on card, signing\n * EC P-256 and P-384 key generation\n * EC Diffie-Hellman on P-256 and P-384\n * ECDSA (only when using JavaCard 3.0.4+ builds)\n    - JC 2.2.2 builds have a hash-on-card workaround (see below), but this is\n      not standard PIV\n * PINs and change of PIN, PUK reset\n * Support for both 3DES and AES card administration keys\n * Most https://developers.yubico.com/PIV/Introduction/Yubico_extensions.html[\n   YubiKeyPIV-compatible extensions] are implemented and working:\n    - PIN policy\n    - Version indicator (we pretend to be a YK5)\n    - Fetch serial number (randomly generated)\n    - Set management key\n    - Import asymmetric key\n    - Reset after PIN+PUK blocked\n    - Change PIN/PUK retry limits\n    - Attestation using slot F9\n    - Get metadata (5.3.0)\n\nWhat doesn't work:\n\n * YubicoPIV touch policy\n   - No standard JavaCard APIs for accessing GPIO or sensors so this is\n     probably not happening.\n\n## Installing\n\nThe pre-built `.cap` files for each release can be found on the\nhttps://github.com/arekinath/pivapplet/releases[project release page].\n\nYou can use the\nhttps://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro[Global Platform] command-line\ntool (`gp`) to upload the applet to your JavaCard:\n\n-----\n$ gp -install PivApplet.cap\nCAP loaded\n-----\n\nNow you have a PIV card ready to initialise. It's easiest to do the\ninitialisation with the\nhttps://developers.yubico.com/yubico-piv-tool/[`yubico-piv-tool`]:\n\n-----\n$ yubico-piv-tool -r '' -a list-readers\nAlcor Micro AU9560 00 00\nYubico Yubikey 4 OTP+U2F+CCID 01 00\n\n$ yubico-piv-tool -r Alcor -a generate -s 9e > pubkey-9e.pem\nSuccessfully generated a new private key.\n\n$ yubico-piv-tool -r Alcor -a selfsign-certificate -s 9e \\\n    -S '/CN=test' < pubkey-9e.pem > cert-9e.pem\nSuccessfully generated a new self signed certificate.\n\n$ yubico-piv-tool -r Alcor -a import-certificate -s 9e < cert-9e.pem\nSuccessfully imported a new certificate.\n-----\n\nNow your PIV token is set up with a self-signed Card Authentication (`9e`)\nkey. You can generate keys and certificates in the other slots in a similar\nfashion (remember that most other slots default to requiring a PIN entry,\nwhich you have to do with `-a verify-pin -a selfsign-certificate ...` when\nusing `yubico-piv-tool`).\n\nSample output of `yubico-piv-tool -a status`:\n\n-----\nCHUID:\t301900000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000341047132924dfd1f7581290d383781dc81a350832303530303130313e00fe00\nCCC:\tf015a000000116ff02b8907468b1e6d143231c5c7c452df10121f20121f300f400f50110f600f700fa00fb00fc00fd00fe00\nSlot 9e:\n\tAlgorithm:\tRSA2048\n\tSubject DN:\tCN=test\n\tIssuer DN:\tCN=test\n\tFingerprint:\tacbc68b8ec8a25432a296801e4deb375a14b4d78f35016f8729a7c481040eb9a\n\tNot Before:\tJun 19 05:33:06 2017 GMT\n\tNot After:\tJun 19 05:33:06 2018 GMT\nPIN tries left:\t5\n-----\n\n## Default admin key & PINs\n\nDefault PIN:: `123456`\nDefault PUK:: `12345678`\nDefault card administration (`9B`) key:: `01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 ...`\n\n(This is the default used by Yubikeys, so that the `yubico-piv-tool` will\nwork with PivApplet.)\n\nNote that if 3DES admin key support is disabled, the default card\nadministration key will be AES-128 instead (with the first 16 bytes of the\ndefault 3DES key as its value).\n\n## ECDSA hash-on-card extension\n\nWhen built for JavaCard 2.2.2, this applet supports an extension for doing ECDSA\nwith hash-on-card, which client software will have to specifically add support\nfor if it wants to use ECDSA signing. As of writing, the only PIV client with\nsupport for this extension known to the authors is\nhttps://github.com/arekinath/pivy[`pivy`].\n\nUnfortunately, regular PIV ECDSA signing is not possible with the JavaCard\nstandard crypto functions in JC2.2.2 (it is possible in JC3.0.4 and later,\nand builds of this applet for 3.0.4 use the standardised method), which only\nsupport a single operation that combines hashing and signing. The current PIV\nstandard demands that the data to be signed is hashed by the host, and then the\nhash is sent to the card.\n\nIn addition to the algorithm ID `0x11` for `ECCP256`, we introduce two new IDs,\n`ECCP256-SHA1` (`0xF0`) and `ECCP256-SHA256` (`0xF1`). For key generation the\nclient should continue to use `ECCP256` (as well as for ECDH), but for signing\none of the two new algorithm IDs must be used (`ECCP256` will be rejected).\n\nThese two new algorithms are \"hash-on-card\" algorithms, where the \"challenge\"\ntag sent by the host to the card should include the full data to be signed\nwithout any hashing applied. The card will hash the data and return the\nsignature in the same was as a normal EC signature.\n\nFor example, to sign the payload `\"foo\\n\"` with the Card Authentication (9e)\nkey, with SHA-256, the host could send the following APDU:\n\n```\n00 87 F1 9E 0A 7C 08 82 00 81 04 66 6F 6F 0A\n```\n\nThis extension, naturally, will not work with existing PIV host software that is\nnot aware of it. It is supported as a workaround for users who are ok with\ncustomising their host software who really want to use ECDSA.\n\nSupport for these new algorithms is advertised in the `0xAC` (supported\nalgorithms) tag in the response to `INS_SELECT`. Client software may detect\nit there to decide whether to attempt use hash-on-card or not.\n\n## Building the project\n\nWe use https://github.com/martinpaljak/ant-javacard[ant-javacard] for builds.\n\n-----\n$ git clone https://github.com/arekinath/PivApplet\n...\n\n$ cd PivApplet\n$ git submodule init && git submodule update\n...\n\n$ export JC_HOME=/path/to/jckit-2.2.2\n$ ant\n-----\n\nThe capfile will be output in the `./bin` directory, along with the `.class`\nfiles (which can be used with jCardSim).\n\nYou can also download pre-built capfiles from the\nhttps://github.com/arekinath/PivApplet/releases[releases page] here on GitHub.\n\nThe applet can be configured to suit different cards or needs by adjusting\nthe feature flags in `build.xml` before running `ant`.\n\nCurrently available feature flags:\n\n|===\n|`PIV_SUPPORT_3DES`       | `D` | Enable support for 3DES admin keys\n|`PIV_SUPPORT_AES`        | `a` | Enable support for AES admin keys\n|`PIV_SUPPORT_RSA`        | `R` | Enable RSA support\n|`PIV_SUPPORT_EC`         | `E` | Enable ECDSA and ECDH support\n|`PIV_SUPPORT_ECCP384`    | `e` | Enable P-384 support with ECDSA/ECDH\n|`PIV_USE_EC_PRECOMPHASH` | `P` | Use JC3.0.4+ API to allow standardised PIV ECDSA (rather than the hash-on-card extension, which will be disabled)\n|`PIV_STRICT_CONTACTLESS` | `S` | Block most slots and keys from use over contactless (strictly conform to the PIV spec)\n|`YKPIV_ATTESTATION`      | `A` | Enable YubicoPIV-style attestation slot and command\n|`APPLET_EXTLEN`          | `x` | Support for extended APDUs. Some cards have bugs that make this feature malfunction (e.g. ACOSJ)\n|`APPLET_LOW_TRANSIENT`   | `L` | Reduce required transient memory for the applet by shrinking buffers. Reduces maximum certificate size and may impact performance. Cannot be used with `YKPIV_ATTESTATION`.\n|===\n\nTested card configurations:\n\n|===\n|NXP J3H145        | JC3.0.4      | `REePSAx`, `REePSAxaD`\n|NXP J3D081        | JC2.2.2      | `RESAx`\n|NXP J2A040        | JC2.2.2      | `RESAx`\n|JC30M48CR         | JC3.0.4      | `ESPxL`, `RSxL`\n|ACOSJ 40k D1      | JC3.0.4      | `REePSA`\n|G&D StarSign CUT  | JC3.0.4      | `REePSAx`, `REePSAxaD`\n|===\n\nAs of v0.8.0, the builds on the releases page are labelled with these same\nabbreviations.\n\n## Simulation\n\nSimulator testing for this project has so far been done on Linux, using\njCardSim (both with and without a Virtual Smartcard Reader).\n\nThe easiest way to do it on Linux is with a virtual reader:\n\n 1. Install `vsmartcard` (see\n    http://frankmorgner.github.io/vsmartcard/virtualsmartcard/README.html[here],\n    but it might also be in your distro's package manager). Once it's installed\n    (and PCSCd restarted) your list of smartcard readers on the system (try\n    `opensc-tool -l` or `yubico-piv-tool -a list-readers`) should include a\n    bunch of `Virtual PCD` entries.\n 2. Clone my fork of `jCardSim` (https://github.com/arekinath/jcardsim)\n    and build it (using `mvn initialize && mvn clean install`)\n 3. From the `pivapplet` directory (after running `ant` to build), run:\n    `java -noverify -cp bin/:../jcardsim/target/jcardsim-3.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar com.licel.jcardsim.remote.VSmartCard test/jcardsim.cfg`\n\nNow you should see a card appear in the first of the `Virtual PCD` readers. To\nstart the PivApplet up, send it a command like this:\n\n```\n$ opensc-tool -r 'Virtual PCD 00 00' -s '80 b8 00 00 12 0b a0 00 00 03 08 00 00 10 00 01 00 05 00 00 02 0F 0F 7f'\n```\n\nThen you should see the simulated PivApplet come to life! The forked jCardSim\ncurrently spits out debug output on the console including full APDUs sent and\nreceived, and stack traces of exceptions (very useful!).\n\nYou can also use the simulator with `jdb`, the Java debugger:\n\n```\n$ jdb -noverify -classpath bin/:../jcardsim/target/jcardsim-3.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar com.licel.jcardsim.remote.VSmartCard test/jcardsim.cfg\nInitializing jdb ...\n> stop at net.cooperi.pivapplet.PivApplet:1769\nDeferring breakpoint net.cooperi.pivapplet.PivApplet:1769.\nIt will be set after the class is loaded.\n> run\nrun com.licel.jcardsim.remote.VSmartCard test/jcardsim.cfg\nSet uncaught java.lang.Throwable\nSet deferred uncaught java.lang.Throwable\n>\nVM Started:\n\n== APDU\n0000:  00 A4 04 00  09 A0 00 00\n0008:  03 08 00 00  10 00 00\njavacard.framework.ISOException\n  at javacard.framework.ISOException.throwIt(Unknown Source)\n  at net.cooperi.pivapplet.PivApplet.sendOutgoing(PivApplet.java:470)\n  at net.cooperi.pivapplet.PivApplet.sendSelectResponse(PivApplet.java:435)\n  at net.cooperi.pivapplet.PivApplet.process(PivApplet.java:284)\n  at com.licel.jcardsim.base.SimulatorRuntime.transmitCommand(SimulatorRuntime.java:303)\n  at com.licel.jcardsim.base.Simulator.transmitCommand(Simulator.java:263)\n  at com.licel.jcardsim.base.CardManager.dispatchApduImpl(CardManager.java:66)\n  at com.licel.jcardsim.base.CardManager.dispatchApdu(CardManager.java:36)\n  at com.licel.jcardsim.remote.VSmartCard$IOThread.run(VSmartCard.java:151)\n== Reply APDU\n0000:  61 3D 4F 0B  A0 00 00 03\n0008:  08 00 00 10  00 01 00 79\n0010:  0D 4F 0B A0  00 00 03 08\n0018:  00 00 10 00  01 00 50 09\n0020:  50 69 76 41  70 70 6C 65\n0028:  74 AC 14 80  01 03 80 01\n0030:  06 80 01 07  80 01 11 80\n0038:  01 F0 80 01  F1 06 00 90\n0040:  00\n== APDU\n0000:  00 CB 3F FF  03 5C 01 7E\n0008:  08\n\nBreakpoint hit: \"thread=Thread-0\", net.cooperi.pivapplet.PivApplet.processGetData(), line=1,769 bci=70\n\nThread-0[1] wherei\n  [1] net.cooperi.pivapplet.PivApplet.processGetData (PivApplet.java:1,769), pc = 70\n  [2] net.cooperi.pivapplet.PivApplet.process (PivApplet.java:290), pc = 146\n  [3] com.licel.jcardsim.base.SimulatorRuntime.transmitCommand (SimulatorRuntime.java:303), pc = 223\n  [4] com.licel.jcardsim.base.Simulator.transmitCommand (Simulator.java:263), pc = 12\n  [5] com.licel.jcardsim.base.CardManager.dispatchApduImpl (CardManager.java:66), pc = 102\n  [6] com.licel.jcardsim.base.CardManager.dispatchApdu (CardManager.java:36), pc = 5\n  [7] com.licel.jcardsim.remote.VSmartCard$IOThread.run (VSmartCard.java:151), pc = 109\nThread-0[1] dump buffer\n buffer = {\n0, -53, 63, -1, 3, 92, 1, 126, 8\n}\nThread-0[1] dump tlv.s\n tlv.s = {\n0, 0, 3, 3\n}\nThread-0[1] dump incoming.state\n incoming.state = {\n0, 63, 63, 0, 63, 63, 0, 0\n}\nThread-0[1] ...\n```\n"

Suffixes, prefixes, page numbers and author suppression can be set by clicking the selected citation in the search box and filling out the options, but these do *not* work in MultiMarkdown output. The resultant citation text will then be entered into the app you were working in when you ran the script. Since the script is basically typing the citation into your application, it should work with any word processor (and any others that accept text input as well).\n\nPlease report any errors as issues on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/davepwsmith/zotpick-applescript).\n\n---\n\n## With Scrivener\nSet one of the applets as your reference manager in Scrivener, call up with \u2318-Y.\n\nThese applets work well in conjunction with [this workflow](http://davepwsmith.github.io/academic-scrivener-howto/) for using Scrivener, Pandoc, Zotero and Marked 2 for academic writing.\n\n## With other Apps\n\nOne or both of these approaches will work:\n\n- To use these scripts with any application is to put them in your ~/Library/Scripts folder. Or to use them with one specific app, put them inside a folder with that app's name inside the Scripts folder.\n- If you use an app-launching utility that lets you assign key combos to apps, use that to launch these scripts."

Clone this repository somewhere on your machine. This guide will assume `~/.zsh/zsh-apple-touchbar`.\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-apple-touchbar ~/.zsh/zsh-apple-touchbar\n```\n\n2. Add the following to your `.zshrc`:\n\n```sh\nsource ~/.zsh/zsh-apple-touchbar/zsh-apple-touchbar.zsh\n```\n\n3. Start a new terminal session.\n\n\n### Oh My Zsh\n\n1. Clone this repository into `$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins` (by default `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins`)\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-apple-touchbar $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-apple-touchbar\n```\n\n2. Add the plugin to the list of plugins for Oh My Zsh to load:\n\n```sh\nplugins=(zsh-apple-touchbar)\n```\n\n3. Start a new terminal session.\n\n## Customization\n\n### Automatic\n\nYou can define simple commands for FN keys in `config.yml` file. \n\n#### Structure\n\nFile should have two base keys:\n1. `default_view` - default view to show.\n2. `views` - list of defined views.\n\n`views` section contains views you want to show. **Key is a view name.**\n\nUnder view name key you should define next keys:\n1. `text` -  text that will show on touchbar key.\n2. `command` or `view` - `command` means executing some command that under is this key and `view` means show view that is under this key\n3. `back` - under this key should be a view name that will be shown after executing some command.\n\n#### Example\n\n```yml\ndefault_view: first\nviews:\n  first:\n    1:\n      text: \ud83d\udc49 pwd\n      command: pwd |tr -d \"\\\\n\" |pbcopy\n    2:\n      text: second view\n      view: second\n    3:\n      text: third view\n      view: third\n  second:\n    1:\n      text: \ud83d\udc48 back\n      view: first\n    2:\n      text: current path\n      command: pwd\n    back: first\n  third:\n    1:\n      text: \ud83d\udc48 back\n      view: first\n    2:\n      text: ls\n      command: ls -la\n```\n\nFor generating view from `config.yml` file go to its folder:\n\n```sh\ncd $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-apple-touchbar\n```\n\nand run `generate.rb` file:\n\n```sh\nruby generate.rb\n```\n\n### Custom\nIf you need more complicated logic you can rewrite `zsh-apple-touchbar.zsh` file on your own.\n\n#### View functions\nFor each `view` you need to define separate function that will contain keys creation. E.G.\n\n```bash\nfunction first_view() {\n  remove_and_unbind_keys\n\n  set_state 'first'\n\n  create_key 1 '\ud83d\udc49 pwd' 'pwd |tr -d \"\\\\n\" |pbcopy' '-s'\n  create_key 2 'second view' 'second_view'\n}\n\nfunction second_view() {\n  remove_and_unbind_keys\n\n  set_state 'second'\n\n  create_key 1 '\ud83d\udc48 back' 'first_view'\n  create_key 2 'current path' 'pwd' '-s'\n\n  set_state 'first'\n}\n```\n\nIn every function first, you need to remove and unbind old keys with `remove_and_unbind_keys` function.\n\nThen you need to set a state (`state` variable define which view to show after reinitialization) with `set_state` function.\n\nAfter that, you can create keys for this view with `create_key` function.\n\nAnd after keys part you can set new state (if you want to show some view after executing key command).\n\n#### Keys creation\nKeys creates with `create_key` function\n\nThis function accept 4 arguments:\n1. number of key (from 1 to 12)\n2. key text\n3. `command` or `view`\n4. bind option (`-s` if third argument isn't a view, nothing if it is)\n\n#### Init widgets\nFor calling views in main function you need to init widgets for every view function.\n\n```bash\nzle -N first\nzle -N second\n```\n\n#### Main function\nHere you need to define which view to show for every state.\n\n```bash\nprecmd_apple_touchbar() {\n  case $state in\n    first) first_view ;;\n    second) second_view ;;\n  esac\n}\n```\n\n#### Full example\n```bash\nsource ${0:A:h}/functions.zsh\n\nset_state 'first'\n\nfunction first_view() {\n  remove_and_unbind_keys\n\n  set_state 'first'\n\n  create_key 1 '\ud83d\udc49 pwd' 'pwd |tr -d \"\\\\n\" |pbcopy' '-s'\n  create_key 2 'second view' 'second_view'\n}\n\nfunction second_view() {\n  remove_and_unbind_keys\n\n  set_state 'second'\n\n  create_key 1 '\ud83d\udc48 back' 'first_view'\n  create_key 2 'current path' 'pwd' '-s'\n\n  set_state 'first'\n}\n\nzle -N first_view\nzle -N second_view\n\nprecmd_apple_touchbar() {\n  case $state in\n    first) first_view ;;\n    second) second_view ;;\n  esac\n}\n\nautoload -Uz add-zsh-hook\n\nadd-zsh-hook precmd precmd_apple_touchbar\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you have some proposals how to improve this boilerplate feel free to open issues and send pull requests!\n\n1.

To browse them, there's a [dedicated Mac app](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/) called SF Symbols. However, developers still have to copy the name of a symbol and reference it unsafely, resulting in code like this:\n\n```swift\nUIImage(systemName: \"circle.fill\")\n```\n\nIt didn't take long until [first ideas came up](https://twitter.com/simjp/status/1135642837322588161?s=12) to make these icons **accessible in a safe way** using a framework. And this is just the basic idea behind `SFSafeSymbols`!\n\nFurthermore, with `SFSafeSymbols`...\n\n- ... you can be sure your symbol code won't crash due to typos or symbol availability issues. This is because **all symbols are tested via a CI** (on the latest iOS & tvOS versions and also some earlier OS versions).\n- ... lookups in the SF Symbols app (e. g. about available **layersets**, available **localizations** & the **look of the symbol**) are no longer needed because every symbol is **documented in code**.\n- ... **multiple SF Symbols versions** are supported at the same time (via utilization of the `@availability` flag). Each symbol is only made available on those platform versions where Apple says it's available.\n- ... **renamed symbols can be detected easily** (via a deprecation notice which suggests the use of the new name at the same time).\n\n## Supported Versions\n\nThe following SF Symbols versions are currently supported:\n\n| SF Symbols Version | iOS Version | macOS Version | tvOS Version | watchOS Version |\n| ------------------ | ----------- | ------------- | ------------ | --------------- |\n| 1.0 |\u00a013.0 | 11.0 | 13.0 | 6.0 |\n| 1.1 |\u00a013.1 | 11.0 | 13.0 | 6.1 |\n| 2.0 |\u00a014.0 | 11.0 | 14.0 | 7.0 |\n| 2.1 |\u00a014.2 | 11.0 | 14.2 | 7.1 |\n| 2.2 |\u00a014.5 | 11.3 | 14.5 | 7.4 |\n| 3.0 |\u00a015.0 | 12.0 | 15.0 | 8.0 |\n| 3.1 |\u00a015.1 | 12.0 | 15.1 | 8.1 |\n| 3.2 |\u00a015.2 | 12.1 | 15.2 | 8.3 |\n| 3.3 |\u00a015.4 | 12.3 | 15.4 | 8.5 |\n\n## Installation\n\n`SFSafeSymbols` can be installed via the **Swift Package Manager (recommended)**, Carthage or CocoaPods.\n\nSupported platforms are `iOS (11.0+)`, `macOS (10.13+)`, `tvOS (11.0+)` and `watchOS (4.0+)`, although the actual functionality is of course only accessible starting with `iOS 13.0`, `macOS 11.0`, `tvOS 13.0` and `watchOS 6.0`.\n\n### Swift Package Manager (Xcode-integrated)\n\nTo integrate SFSafeSymbols using the Xcode-built-in SPM, choose `File` \u2192 `Swift Packages` \u2192 `Add Package Dependency`. Enter the following url: `https://github.com/SFSafeSymbols/SFSafeSymbols` and click `Next`. When asked about the version, leave the preselection and click `Next`. In the following step, select `SFSafeSymbols` as the package product and click `Finish`.\n\n### Swift Package Manager (standalone)\n\nTo integrate using the standalone version of Apple's Swift Package Manager, add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:\n\n```swift\n.package(url: \"https://github.com/SFSafeSymbols/SFSafeSymbols.git\", .upToNextMajor(from: \"3.3.2\"))\n```\n\nAfter specifying `\"SFSafeSymbols\"` as a dependency of the target in which you want to use it, run `swift package update`.\n\n### Carthage\n\nAdd the following entry to your Cartfile:\n\n```\ngithub \"SFSafeSymbols/SFSafeSymbols\" ~> 3.3.2\n```\n\nThen run `carthage update`.\n\n### CocoaPods\n\nAdd the following entry to your Podfile:\n\n```rb\npod 'SFSafeSymbols', '~> 3.3.2'\n```\n\nThen run `pod install`.\n\n## Usage\n\nAll the system symbols are accessible via the `SFSymbol` type. They are named similar to Apple's names, but use a lower camel case style and prefix names with leading numbers with a `_` character:\n\n```\nc.circle        ~> SFSymbol.cCircle\ne.circle.fill   ~> SFSymbol.eCircleFill\n11.circle.fill  ~> SFSymbol._11CircleFill\n```\n\nA SF Symbol `UIImage` can now be initialized using the `SFSymbol` type. This image is already unwrapped, so you get a `UIImage` instead of a `UIImage?`:\n\n```swift\nUIImage(systemSymbol: .cCircle)\nUIImage(systemSymbol: SFSymbol.eCircleFill)\nUIImage(systemSymbol: ._11CircleFill, withConfiguration: /* Some UIImage.Configuration */)\n```\n\nA SF Symbol `SwiftUI.Image` can also be initialized using the `SFSymbol` type:\n\n```swift\nImage(systemSymbol: .cCircle)\nImage(systemSymbol: SFSymbol.eCircleFill)\n```\n\nThere are also `SwiftUI.Label` initializers:\n\n```swift\nLabel(\"MyText\", systemSymbol: .cCircle)\nLabel(LocalizedStringKey(\"my.text\"), systemSymbol: SFSymbol.eCircleFill)\n```\n\n... and interfaces for `UIButton`:\n\n```swift\nlet button = UIButton.systemButton(with: .cCircle, target: self, selector: #selector(testMethod))\nbutton.setImage(.eCircleFill, for: .normal)\n```\n\n... and an initializer for `UIApplicationShortcutItem`:\n\n```swift\nUIApplicationShortcutIcon(systemSymbol: .cCircle)\nUIApplicationShortcutIcon(systemSymbol: SFSymbol.eCircleFill)\n```\n\n... and finally also an initializer for AppKit's `NSImage`:\n\n```swift\nNSImage(systemSymbol: .cCircle)\nNSImage(systemSymbol: SFSymbol.eCircleFill, accessibilityDescription: \"some.description\")\n```\n\n### Localization\n\nSF Symbols can come with multiple different localizations. `SFSafeSymbols` exposes localization the following way:\n\n- Implicit localization: When using an `SFSymbol`, it gets automatically localized to the user's current locale - nothing to do on your part. This behavior is managed by Apple's system implementation of SF Symbols.\n\n- Explicit localization: `SFSafeSymbols` lets you access a symbol's localized versions as follows:\n\n  ```swift\n  // 1. Static localization:\n  let a = SFSymbol.character.ar // corresponds to \"character.ar\"\n  let b = SFSymbol.character.zh // corresponds to \"character.zh\"\n  let c = SFSymbol.character.rtl // doesn't compile: \"character.rtl\" doesn't exist\n  // a, b have type SFSymbol\n  \n  // 2. Dynamic localization:\n  SFSymbol.character.availableLocalizations // [.ar, .he, .hi, .ja, .ko, .th, .zh, .zhTraditional]\n  let a = SFSymbol.character.localized(to: .ar)\n  let b = SFSymbol.character.localized(to: .rtl)\n  // a, b have type SFSymbol?\n  ```\n\n  Static localization only exposes the localizations which are actually available, so you cannot accidentally localize a non-localizable symbol.\n\n  Dynamic localization, in contrast, is useful when dealing with an array of `SFSymbols` which all have different available localizations.\n\nAttention: Serializing and deserializing `SFSymbol`s currently makes them lose their _explicit_ static localization information. Dynamic localization information will still be retained.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very much welcome!

  "language": "Python",
  "readme_contents": "BSDPy 1.0\n=========\n\nBSDPy is a platform-independent Apple NetBoot (BSDP) service for organizations\nthat have a need for Apple Mac NetBoot functionality but that lack the ability\nto support OS X server in order to implement it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nGeneral Functionality\n---------------------\n\nThe BSDPy service provides the same NetInstall feature set provided by Apple's\nOS X Server, which depending on the OS X version is either called \"NetBoot\" or\n\"NetInstall\". Management tools like DeployStudio and JAMF Casper which rely on a\nNetInstall-style image to launch an imaging client that writes a disk image to a\nlocal HD or SSD and performs post-imaging configuration are fully compatible\nwith BSDPy. NetInstall-style images created by Apple's System Image Utility or\nany other tools that create a NetInstall-style NBI are also fully compatible.\nBSDPy does not currently support the less frequently used diskless NetBoot mode\nwhich relies on a shadow disk image to be mounted from an AFP share. Shadowing\nusing a RAM disk or local storage is fully supported.\n\n\u00a0\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nTo function, BSDPy needs to be given a valid network interface to listen on, the\nboot image network protocol to use and the boot image root path on the host. By\ndefault it uses **\"eth0\"**, **\"HTTP\"** and **\"/nbi\"** for these settings.\nConfiguration of BSDPy is mainly done through environment variables due to its\nDocker-leaning deployment preference. A few basic items like aforementioned\nrequired network interface, boot image protocol and NBI root path can also be\nset using command line flags. The complete set of configuration items is as\nfollows, with defaults in square brackets:\n\n\u00a0\n\n### Supported environment variables\n\n-   **BSDPY\\_IFACE** - Interface to listen on - *['eth0']*\n\n-   **BSDPY\\_PROTO** - Protocol to serve boot image - *['http']*\n\n-   **BSDPY\\_NBI\\_PATH** - Root path to NBIs - *['/nbi']*\n\n-   **BSDPY\\_IP** - Public IP BSDPy listens on - (optional)\n\n-   **BSDPY\\_NBI\\_URL** - Alternate base URL for boot images (HTTP/NFS) -\n    (optional)\n\n-   **BSDPY\\_API\\_URL** - API endpoint to obtain NBI entitlements - (optional)\n\n-   **BSDPY\\_API\\_KEY** - API key to use in conjunction with BSDPY\\_API\\_URL -\n    (required with API URL)\n\n\u00a0\n\n### Supported runtime flags\n\n-   **-i** *['eth0']* - Interface to listen on\n\n-   **-r** *['http']* - Protocol to serve boot image\n\n-   **-p** *['/nbi']* - Root path to NBIs\n\n\u00a0\n\nModes of Operation\n------------------\n\n\u00a0\n\nBSDPy has a few distinct modes of operation:\n\n1.  Self-contained, single-host mode\n\n2.  Separate NBI repository mode\n\n3.  API-connected mode\n\n\u00a0\n\nRegardless of the mode of operation a functional TFTP service must be running on\nthe same host as BSDPy. In addition to TFTP the self-contained mode also\nrequires a properly configured HTTP or NFS service to be running. Specific\nconfiguration details regarding the TFTP, HTTP and NFS services will be covered\nin the **\"Deployment methods\"** section later in this document.\n\n\u00a0\n\n### Running self-contained\n\nWhen running in self-contained mode BSDPy and its NBI content and supporting\nservices are located on the same host. This means that BSDP, TFTP and HTTP/NFS\nservices are all running on the host with a local directory containing one or\nmore NBI bundles. By default this directory is `/nbi`.\n\nRequired settings (defaults in brackets):\n\n-   **BSDPY\\_IFACE** or **-i** *['eth0']*\n\n-   **BSDPY\\_PROTO** or **-r** *['http']*\n\n-   **BSDPY\\_NBI\\_PATH** or **-p** *['/nbi']*\n\n\u00a0\n\nRequired **local** services:\n\n-   **BSDPy** listening on port **67 UDP**\n\n-   **TFTPD** listening on port **69 UDP**\n\n-   **HTTPD** listening on port **80 TCP** or **NFSD** listening on ports\n    **110**, **2049 UDP**/**TCP**\n\n\u00a0\n\n### Running with a separate NBI repository\n\nWhen running in this mode BSDPy will poll a filesystem location on the host it\nis running on for NBI bundles to offer. All files that are to be served by TFTP\n(booter, kernelcache) will also originate from this host.

Once the client completes loading the booter,\ncom.apple.Boot.plist, PlatformSupport.plist and kernelcache files it will send a\nrequest to mount `NetInstall.dmg`. With `BSDPY_NBI_URL` set to\n`http://mynbirepo.org/netboot`, the request for `NetInstall.dmg` will now be\nsent as a URI made up of the contents of the environment variable (optionally\nconverted to an IP address if a DNS hostname was used) and the relative path to\nNetInstall.dmg from the root directory set by `BSDPY_NBI_PATH` on the BSDPy\nhost:\n\n`BSDPY_NBI_URL` = `http://10.0.1.100/netboot`\n\n\\+\n\n`BSDPY_NBI_PATH` = `109-13E28.nbi/NetInstall.dmg`\n\n=\n\n`http://10.0.1.100/netboot/109-13E28.nbi/NetInstall.dmg`\n\nThe NBI repository host has the same NBI bundle(s) stored on disk and a **HTTP**\nservice has been configured to serve their parent location at the URL set with\n`BSDPY_NBI_PATH`: `http://mynbirepo.org/netboot`. Now, when a request for\n`http://10.0.1.100/netboot/OSX109-13E28.nbi/NetInstall.dmg` is received from a\nclient it is successfully handled by the HTTP service on the NBI repository\nserver and the client mounts the image and boots. The same general\nbehind-the-scenes process applies if BSDPy was configured to use **NFS** as boot\nimage protocol instead, but the URI will instead look similar to this:\n`nfs:10.0.1.100/netboot/OSX109-13E28.nbi/NetInstall.dmg` - the NFS service\nshould be configured to allow all connections to `mynbirepo.org:/netboot` in\n`/etc/exports`.\n\n\u00a0\n\n### Running with an API endpoint\n\nIf BSDPy is run with `BSDPY_API_URL` set it will not poll the local filesystem\nfor valid NBI bundles but instead send a **HTTP GET** request to the provided\nAPI endpoint for NBI entitlements. An API call is made for each client that\nsends a **BSDP LIST** request. At startup BSDPy will also make an API call to\nretrieve all available NBIs and cache all TFTP content (`booter`,\n`com.apple.Boot.plist`, `PlatformSupport.plist` and `kernelcache`) to the local\nTFTP root directory via HTTP or NFS, depending on `BSDPY_PROTO`. It is important\nthat permissions for the NBI bundles on the remote server are set to allow\ndownloading of all files below the `ImageName.nbi` directory level. A TFTP\nservice running alongside BSDPy will serve the contents from this TFTP root\ndirectory to clients. Unless `BSDPY_NBI_PATH` is set the default location of the\nTFTP root directory is `/nbi`.\n\n\u00a0\n\nRequired settings (defaults in brackets):\n\n-   **BSDPY\\_IFACE** or **-i** *[eth0]*\n\n-   **BSDPY\\_API\\_URL** (\"http(s)://myapiserver.org:port/{SOME\\_ENDPOINT}\")\n\n-   **BSDPY\\_API\\_KEY** (\"SOMEAPIKEYHERE\")\n\n\u00a0\n\nRequired **local** services:\n\n-   **BSDPy** listening on port **67 UDP**\n\n-   **TFTPD** listening on port **69 UDP**\n\n\u00a0\n\nRequired **remote** services:\n\n-   **HTTPD** listening on port **80 TCP** or **NFSD** listening on ports\n    **110**, **2049 UDP**/**TCP**\n\n-   **HTTPD** listening on **any available port**, either **HTTP** or **HTTPS**\n\n\u00a0\n\n### API requests and responses\n\nWhen making the \"all images\" call the following parameter is sent in the **HTTP\nGET** request:\n\n-   `all=True` - (boolean)\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen making the per-client API call the following parameters are sent in the\n**HTTP GET** request:\n\n-   `ip_address` - A valid IP address (string)\n\n-   `mac_address` - A valid MAC address, colon-separated (string)\n\n-   `model_name` - A valid Apple model ID, e.g. `MacBookPro10,1` (string)\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe API response should be in JSON format, with a content type of\n`application/json`.

Other fields may be added for your\norganization's needs as well but will be ignored by BSDPy. The `priority` key\nshould be unique and additionally should be greater than **1024** if more than\none BSDPy instance will be running on the same network segment for compatibility\nwith the BSDP client's load balancing host selection mechanism.\n\n![](<https://bytebucket.org/bruienne/bsdpy/raw/1a7eee604bfbb548ddc02e4d1ab3bb1dfee37b3b/BSDPy.images/N6n3r4.jpg>)\n\nLinux run mode\n--------------\n\nAs of version 1.0 the recommended way to run the BSDPy service is as a Docker\ncontainer, with supporting containers for the TFTP, HTTP and NFS services. It is\nalso still possible to run the service directly on most modern Linux\ndistributions but support for any distribution-specific implemenation is up to\nthe individual sys admin. That said, the service does not have a very\ncomplicated set of requirements if run this way.\n\n\u00a0\n\n### Linux single host\n\nTo run the BSDPy service from a single Linux host the required BSDPy settings,\nservices and ports as outlined in the **Running self-contained **section earlier\nin this document can be used. Settings can be provided either via command line\nflags or environment variables. To recap, the `BSDPy` service, `TFTP` service\nand either `HTTP` or `NFS` services will all be running on the same host and\nconnecting clients will be sent the same IP address or host name for all\nrequests.\n\nA sample setup for CentOS 6.4 from an earlier version of this README follows.\n\n\u00a0\n\nInstall and start the TFTP and NFS services and clone the required repositories:\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n$ sudo yum -y install gcc xinetd tftp-server nfs-utils nfs-utils-lib git-core python python-devel\n$ sudo sed -i 's/\\/var\\/lib\\/tftpboot/\\/nbi/' /etc/xinetd.d/tftp\n$ sudo sed -i 's/\\-s//' /etc/xinetd.d/tftp\n$ sudo sed -i 's/SELINUX=.*/SELINUX=disabled/' /etc/sysconfig/selinux\n$ sudo sh -c 'echo \"/nbi   *(async,ro,no_root_squash,insecure)\" >> /etc/exports'\n$ sudo mkdir /nbi\n$ sudo chkconfig --levels 235 nfs on\n$ sudo chkconfig --levels 235 xinetd on\n$ sudo chkconfig --levels 235 tftp on\n$ sudo chkconfig --levels 235 iptables off\n$ sudo service nfs start\n$ sudo service xinetd start\n$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/bruienne/bsdpy.git\n$ cd /bsdpy\n$ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOnce the above is complete, one or more NBI bundles must be transferred to the\nserver\u2019s NetBoot service root path, **/nbi**. Assuming SSH is active, using scp\nto copy one or more images over would be straightforward:\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n$ scp -r /Path/To/MyNetBoot.nbi user@bsdpyhost:/nbi\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOnce one or more boot images have been transferred, verify that both TFTP and\nNFS work by testing their connectivity from a client that can reach the BSDPy\nserver:\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n$ showmount -e <ip or hostname of BSDPy server>\nExport list for <ip or hostname of BSDPy server>:\n/nbi *\n$ cd ~/; mkdir nbimount\n$ mount -t nfs <ip or hostname>:/nbi ~/nbimount\n$ ls ~/nbimount\n#Sample output\nDSR-1090.nbi  NI2.nbi  NI.nbi\n\n$ umount ~/nbimount\n$ tftp <ip or hostname>\n#Sample get command\ntftp> get /nbi/MyNetBoot.nbi/i386/booter\nReceived 174997 bytes in 0.2 seconds\ntftp> quit\n$ ls -l booter\n#Sample output\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 994464 May 15  2013 booter\n\n$ rm booter\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf TFTP and NFS check out successfully the BSDPy service can be started:\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n$ cd bsdpy\n$ sudo bsdpserver.py\n#Sample output\n\nDEBUG: BSDPY_NBI_PATH: /nbi  \nDEBUG: BSDPY_IFACE: eth0  \nDEBUG: BSDPY_PROTO: http  \nDEBUG: [========= Updating boot images list =========]  \nDEBUG: Considering NBI source at /nbi/109-13E28.nbi  \nDEBUG: /nbi/109-13E28.nbi  \nDEBUG: [=========\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 End updated list \u00a0 \u00a0 =========]  \nDEBUG: [===== Using the following boot images =======]  \nDEBUG: /nbi/109-13E28.nbi  \nDEBUG: [====== \u00a0 \u00a0 End boot image listing\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ======]  \nDEBUG: -=============================================-  \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBy default BSDPy will assume the service root path is /nbi. If it is not, you\ncan specify it in the CLI:\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n$ sudo bsdpserver.py -p /usr/share/netboot\n#Sample output\n\nDEBUG: BSDPY_NBI_PATH: /usr/share/netboot  \nDEBUG: BSDPY_IFACE: eth0  \nDEBUG: BSDPY_PROTO: http  \nDEBUG: [========= Updating boot images list =========]  \nDEBUG: Considering NBI source at /mynbiroot/109-13E28.nbi  \nDEBUG: /usr/share/netboot/109-13E28.nbi  \nDEBUG: [=========\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 End updated list \u00a0 \u00a0 =========]  \nDEBUG: [===== Using the following boot images =======]  \nDEBUG: /usr/share/netboot/109-13E28.nbi  \nDEBUG: [====== \u00a0 \u00a0 End boot image listing\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ======]  \nDEBUG: -=============================================-\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\u00a0\n\n### Linux multi-host\n\nTo run the BSDPy service using multiple Linux hosts, for example to serve boot\nimages from a dedicated file server or content delivery network, the required\nBSDPy settings, services and ports as outlined in the **Running with a separate\nNBI repository** section earlier in this document can be used. Settings can be\nprovided either via command line flags or environment variables. To recap, the\n`BSDPy` service and `TFTP` service will be running on one host while one or more\nseparate hosts will be running the `HTTP` or `NFS` service. The latter may\nimplement whatever load balancing methodology is appropriate for the\norganization, keeping in mind that when the boot image is requested it will be\ndone using an IP address that was resolved from a hostname, if configured\nthrough `BSDPY_NBI_URL`.\n\nDocker run mode\n---------------\n\n### Single Docker host\n\n### Multiple Docker hosts\n\n"

  "readme_contents": "node-airplay -- AirPlay client library for node.js\n====================================\n\nnode-airplay is a client library for Apple's\n[AirPlay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPlay) remote playback protocol.\nIt implements a simple AirPlay device browser using mdns and command interface.\n\nCurrently supported features:\n\n* AirPlay device discovery\n* Support for audio and video playback\n\nComing soon (maybe):\n\n* Photo playback\n* Robust error handling\n* Better device information formatting (supported features/etc)\n\n## Quickstart\n\n    npm install airplay\n    node\n    > var browser = require('airplay').createBrowser();\n    > browser.on('deviceOnline', function(device) {\n        device.play('http://host/somevideo.mp4', 0);\n      });\n    > browser.start();\n\n## Installation\n\nWith [npm](http://npmjs.org):\n\n    npm install airplay\n\nFrom source:\n\n    cd ~\n    git clone https://benvanik@github.com/benvanik/node-airplay.git\n    npm link node-airplay/\n\nnode-airplay depends on both\n[node-plist](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-plist) and\n[node_mdns](https://github.com/agnat/node_mdns). Unfortunately\nnode_mdns is woefully out of date and has required many tweaks to get working,\nresulting in [a fork](https://github.com/benvanik/node_mdns).\n\nIf you're running node on FreeBSD (or maybe Linux) you may get errors during\ninstall about a missing dns_sd.h file. If so, install the Apple mDNS SDK:\n\n    wget http://www.opensource.apple.com/tarballs/mDNSResponder/mDNSResponder-522.1.11.tar.gz\n    tar zxvf mDNSResponder-522.11.tar.gz\n    cd mDNSResponder-333.10/mDNSPosix/\n    sudo gmake os=freebsd install\n\n## API\n\n### Browser\n\nThe browser is a discovery service that can be run to automatically detect the\nAirPlay-compatiable devices on the local network(s). Try only to create one\nbrowser per node instance, and if it's no longer needed stop it.\n\nCreate a browser using the `createBrowser` method:\n\n    var browser = require('airplay').createBrowser();\n\nAttach to the browser events to track device discovery:\n\n    browser.on('deviceOnline', function(device) {\n      console.log('device online: ' + device.id);\n    });\n    browser.on('deviceOffline', function(device) {\n      console.log('device offline: ' + device.id);\n    });\n\nStart or stop the discovery process:\n\n    browser.start();\n    browser.stop();\n\nIf you are running a server you can use the built-in device list instead of\nmaintaining your own via the events:\n\n    function myHandler() {\n      var devices = browser.getDevices();\n      console.log(devices);\n    }\n\n### Device\n\nA device instance represents a single AirPlay device on the local network.\nDevices are created either through the discovery process or by direct\nconnection. Each device has only a single control channel, and all methods are\nasynchronous.\n\nObtain devices using the browser API:\n\n    // Get all ready devices\n    var allDevices = browser.getDevices();\n    // Grab a device to play with\n    var device = allDevices[0];\n\n*TODO* At some point, you'll be able to connect directly:\n\n    var device = require('airplay').connect(deviceHost);\n    device.on('ready', function() {\n      // Ready to accept commands\n    });\n\nIf you are done with the device, close the connection (note that this will stop\nany playback):\n\n    device.close();\n\nIssue various device control calls. All calls are asynchronous and have an\noptional callback that provides the result - for most, it's an empty object if\nthe call was successful and null if the call failed.\n\n    // Get the current playback status\n    device.getStatus(function(res) {\n      // res = {\n      //   duration: number, -- in seconds\n      //   position: number, -- in seconds\n      //   rate: number, -- 0 = paused, 1 = playing\n      //   ...\n      // }\n      // or, if nothing is playing, res = {}\n    });\n\n    // Play the given content (audio/video/etc)\n    var content = 'http://host/content.mp4';\n    var startPosition = 0; // in seconds\n    device.play(content, startPosition, function(res) {\n      if (res) {\n        // playing\n      } else {\n        // failed to start playback\n      }\n    });\n\n    // Stop playback and return to the main menu\n    device.stop();\n\n    // Seek to the given offset in the media (if seek is supported)\n    var position = 500; // in seconds\n    device.scrub(position);\n\n    // Reverse playback direction (rewind)\n    // NOTE: may not be supported\n    device.reverse();\n\n    // Change the playback rate\n    // NOTE: only 0 and 1 seem to be supported for most media types\n    var rate = 0; // 0 = pause, 1 = resume\n    device.rate(rate);\n\n    // Adjust playback volume\n    // NOTE: may not be supported\n    device.volume(value);\n"

Install Swift\n\nBefore getting started, make sure that you have a Swift toolchain installed.\n\n**Apple users:** Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/).\nIf this is your first time installing it, make sure to open it once after\ninstalling so that the command line tools are correctly configured.\n\n**Linux users:** Follow the instructions on the\n[Swift download page](https://swift.org/download/) to download and install the\nappropriate Swift toolchain for your platform. Take care to ensure that you have\nall of Swift's dependencies installed (such as ICU, Clang, and so forth), and\nalso ensure that the Swift compiler is available on your system path.\n\n### 2. Configure your workspace\n\nAdd the following to your `WORKSPACE` file to add the external repositories,\nreplacing the `urls` and `sha256` attributes with the values from the release\nyou wish to depend on:\n\n```python\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\n\nhttp_archive(\n    name = \"build_bazel_rules_swift\",\n    sha256 = \"12057b7aa904467284eee640de5e33853e51d8e31aae50b3fb25d2823d51c6b8\",\n    url = \"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_swift/releases/download/1.0.0/rules_swift.1.0.0.tar.gz\",\n)\n\nload(\n    \"@build_bazel_rules_swift//swift:repositories.bzl\",\n    \"swift_rules_dependencies\",\n)\n\nswift_rules_dependencies()\n\nload(\n    \"@build_bazel_rules_swift//swift:extras.bzl\",\n    \"swift_rules_extra_dependencies\",\n)\n\nswift_rules_extra_dependencies()\n```\n\nThe `swift_rules_dependencies` macro creates a toolchain appropriate for your\nplatform (either by locating an installation of Xcode on macOS, or looking for\n`swiftc` on the system path on Linux).\n\n### 3. Additional configuration (Linux only)\n\nThe `swift_binary` and `swift_test` rules expect to use `clang` as the driver\nfor linking, and they query the Bazel C++ API and CROSSTOOL to determine which\narguments should be passed to the linker. By default, the C++ toolchain used by\nBazel is `gcc`, so Swift users on Linux need to override this by setting the\nenvironment variable `CC=clang` when invoking Bazel.\n\nThis step is not necessary for macOS users because the Xcode toolchain always\nuses `clang`.\n\n## Building with Custom Toolchains\n\n**macOS hosts:** You can build with a custom toolchain installed in\n`/Library/Developer/Toolchains` instead of Xcode's default. To do so, pass the\nfollowing flag to Bazel:\n\n```lang-none\n--define=SWIFT_CUSTOM_TOOLCHAIN=toolchain.id\n```\n\nwhere `toolchain.id` is the value of the `CFBundleIdentifier` key in the\ntoolchain's Info.plist file.\n\nTo list the available toolchains and their bundle identifiers, you can run:\n\n```command\nbazel run @build_bazel_rules_swift//tools/dump_toolchains\n```\n\n**Linux hosts:** At this time, Bazel uses whichever `swift` executable is\nencountered first on your `PATH`.\n\n## Supporting remote builds\n\nTo make remote builds work correctly with debugging and general\nreproducibility see [this doc](doc/debuggable_remote_swift.md)\n\n## Swift Package Manager Support\n\nTo download, build, and reference external Swift packages as Bazel targets, check out\n[rules_spm](https://github.com/cgrindel/rules_spm).  The rules in\n[rules_spm](https://github.com/cgrindel/rules_spm) build external Swift packages with [Swift\nPackage Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), then make the outputs available to Bazel\nrules.\n\n## Future Work\n\n- Support for building and linking to shared libraries (`.dylib`/`.so`) written\n  in Swift.\n- Migration to the Bazel platforms/toolchains APIs.\n- Support for multiple toolchains, and support for non-Xcode toolchains on\n  macOS.\n- Automatically download a Linux toolchain from [swift.org](https://swift.org)\n  if one is not already installed.\n\n## Supported bazel versions\n\nrules_apple and rules_swift are often affected by changes in bazel\nitself. This means you generally need to update these rules as you\nupdate bazel.\n\nYou can also see the supported bazel versions in the notes for each\nrelease on the [releases\npage](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_swift/releases).\n\nBesides these constraint this repo follows [semver](https://semver.org/)\nas best as we can since the 1.0.0 release.\n\n| Bazel release | Minimum supported rules version | Final supported rules version|\n|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------------:|\n| 6.x (most recent rolling) | 0.27.0 | current |\n| 5.x | 0.25.0 | current |\n| 4.x | 0.19.0 | 0.24.0 |\n| 3.x | 0.14.0 | 0.18.0 |\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the following external packages that rules_swift\ndepends on:\n\n- [Apple Support for Bazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/apple_support) (Google)\n- [Bazel Skylib](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib) (Google)\n- [JSON for Modern C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) (Niels Lohmann)\n- [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) (Google)\n- [Swift gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-swift) (Google)\n- [Swift Protobuf](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf) (Apple)\n- [zlib](https://www.zlib.net) (Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler)\n"

Drop an executable script or binary onto the \"script2droplet-droplet\" icon in Finder\n2. There is no step 2\n\nManual method\n-------------\n\n1. Replace the `main` file in \"Show Package Contents\" Contents/Resources/Scripts with the script you want run\n2. There is no step 2\n\nHow to edit\n===========\n\nThe only \"drag-and-droppable\" save option for AppleScript is \"File Format: Application\". This has the side effect of **not allowing** you to right click the app in Finder and choose \"Open with...\". To edit, you have to either drag this app on top of the AppleScript Editor app, or from the command line do:\n\n    open -b com.apple.ScriptEditor2 script2droplet-droplet.app\n\nEditing the AppleScript will allow you to change 3 options:\n\n    ## Set use_terminal to true to run the script in a terminal\n    set use_terminal to true\n    ## Set exit_terminal to false to leave the terminal session open after script runs\n    set exit_terminal to true\n    ## Set log_file to a file path to have the output captured\n    set log_file to \"/tmp/droplet.log\"\n\n\nMaking git binary friendly\n==========================\n\nBecause AppleScript stores its code in a binary format, it is difficult to use with version control. The included `.gitconfig` can be added to your .git/config to allow text conversion before diffing. It complements the included .gitattributes file\n\nAdd it to your .git/config like so:\n\n    cat .gitconfig >> .git/config\n\nAlternatively, you can use a git 1.7.10+ style include by adding these lines to your .git/config\n\n    [include]\n        path = ../.gitconfig\n\nSample scripts\n==============\n\nfile.sh\n-------\nJust uses the BSD command \"file\" to return info about each of the dropped files.\n\nscript2droplet.sh\n-----------------\nThis is a script that, when placed in a droplet, will create a droplet from the dragged script. Yo dawg!\nA copy of this is used as the default `main` in `AppleScript-droplet.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts/`\n\n[dropbox.sh](http://i.imgur.com/QA2GQdR.png)\n----------\nUploads each of the dropped files to a configurable folder in Dropbox and returns (and copies) the public URL (assuming you have configured it to use a public folder).\nRequires [Dropbox-Uploader] be installed and configured in advance.\n\n[imgur.sh](http://i.imgur.com/LmUvWqB.png)\n--------\nUploads each of the dropped files to imgur and returns (and copies) the public URL.\nCurrently these are anonymous.

Create an array of class `[Event]` and return the array.\n\n```swift\nimport KVKCalendar\n\nclass ViewController: UIViewController {\n    var events = [Event]()\n\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        \n        let calendar = CalendarView(frame: frame)\n        calendar.dataSource = self\n        view.addSubview(calendar)\n        \n        createEvents { (events) in\n            self.events = events\n            self.calendarView.reloadData()\n        }\n    }\n    \n    override func viewWillLayoutSubviews() {\n        super.viewWillLayoutSubviews()\n        // to track changing frame when an user rotates device\n        calendarView.reloadFrame(view.frame)\n    }\n}\n\nextension ViewController {\n    func createEvents(completion: ([Event]) -> Void) {\n        let models = // Get events from storage / API\n        \n        let events = models.compactMap({ (item) in\n            var event = Event(ID: item.id)\n            event.start = item.startDate // start date event\n            event.end = item.endDate // end date event\n            event.color = item.color\n            event.isAllDay = item.allDay\n            event.isContainsFile = !item.files.isEmpty\n            event.recurringType = // recurring event type - .everyDay, .everyWeek\n        \n            // Add text event (title, info, location, time)\n            if item.allDay {\n                event.text = \"\\(item.title)\"\n            } else {\n                event.text = \"\\(startTime) - \\(endTime)\\n\\(item.title)\"\n            }\n            return event\n        })\n        completion(events)\n    }\n}\n\nextension ViewController: CalendarDataSource {\n    func eventsForCalendar(systemEvents: [EKEvent]) -> [Event] {\n        // if you want to get events from iOS calendars\n        // set calendar names to style.systemCalendars = [\"Test\"]\n        let mappedEvents = systemEvents.compactMap { Event(event: $0) }\n        return events + mappedEvents\n    }\n}\n```\n\nImplement `CalendarDelegate` to handle user action and control calendar behaviour.\n\n```swift\ncalendar.delegate = self\n```\n\nTo use a custom view for specific event or date you need to create a new view of class `EventViewGeneral` and return the view in function.\n\n```swift\nclass CustomViewEvent: EventViewGeneral {\n    override init(style: Style, event: Event, frame: CGRect) {\n        super.init(style: style, event: event, frame: frame)\n    }\n}\n\n// an optional function from CalendarDataSource\nfunc willDisplayEventView(_ event: Event, frame: CGRect, date: Date?) -> EventViewGeneral? {\n    guard event.ID == id else { return nil }\n    \n    return customEventView\n}\n```\n\n<img src=\"Screenshots/custom_event_view.png\" width=\"300\">\n\nTo use a custom date cell, just subscribe on this optional method from `CalendarDataSource` (works for Day/Week/Month/Year views).\n```swift\nfunc dequeueCell<T>(parameter: CellParameter, type: CalendarType, view: T, indexPath: IndexPath) -> KVKCalendarCellProtocol? where T: UIScrollView { \n    switch type {\n    case .year:\n        let cell = (view as? UICollectionView)?.dequeueCell(indexPath: indexPath) { (cell: CustomYearCell) in\n            // configure the cell\n        }\n        return cell\n    case .day, .week, .month:    \n        let cell = (view as? UICollectionView)?.dequeueCell(indexPath: indexPath) { (cell: CustomDayCell) in\n            // configure the cell\n        }\n        return cell\n    case .list:    \n        let cell = (view as? UITableView)?.dequeueCell { (cell: CustomListCell) in\n            // configure the cell\n        }\n        return cell\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<img src=\"Screenshots/custom_day_cell.png\" width=\"300\">\n\n## Usage for SwiftUI\n\nAdd a new `SwiftUI` file and import `KVKCalendar`.\nCreate a struct `CalendarDisplayView` and declare the protocol `UIViewRepresentable` for connection `UIKit` with `SwiftUI`.\n\n```swift\nimport SwiftUI\nimport KVKCalendar\n\nstruct CalendarDisplayView: UIViewRepresentable {\n    @Binding var events: [Event]\n\n    private var calendar: CalendarView = {\n        return CalendarView(frame: frame, style: style)\n    }()\n        \n    func makeUIView(context: UIViewRepresentableContext<CalendarDisplayView>) -> CalendarView {\n        calendar.dataSource = context.coordinator\n        calendar.delegate = context.coordinator\n        return calendar\n    }\n    \n    func updateUIView(_ uiView: CalendarView, context: UIViewRepresentableContext<CalendarDisplayView>) {\n        context.coordinator.events = events\n    }\n    \n    func makeCoordinator() -> CalendarDisplayView.Coordinator {\n        Coordinator(self)\n    }\n    \n    public init(events: Binding<[Event]>) {\n        self._events = events\n    }\n    \n    // MARK: Calendar DataSource and Delegate\n    class Coordinator: NSObject, CalendarDataSource, CalendarDelegate {\n        private let view: CalendarDisplayView\n        \n        var events: [Event] = [] {\n            didSet {\n                view.calendar.reloadData()\n            }\n        }\n        \n        init(_ view: CalendarDisplayView) {\n            self.view = view\n            super.init()\n        }\n        \n        func eventsForCalendar(systemEvents: [EKEvent]) -> [Event] {\n            return events\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nCreate a new `SwiftUI` file and add `CalendarDisplayView` to `body`.\n\n```swift\nimport SwiftUI\n\nstruct CalendarContentView: View {\n    @State var events: [Event] = []\n\n    var body: some View {\n        NavigationView {\n            CalendarDisplayView(events: $events)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Styles\n\nTo customize calendar create an object `Style` and add to `init` class `CalendarView`.\n\n```swift\npublic struct Style {\n    public var event = EventStyle()\n    public var timeline = TimelineStyle()\n    public var week = WeekStyle()\n    public var allDay = AllDayStyle()\n    public var headerScroll = HeaderScrollStyle()\n    public var month = MonthStyle()\n    public var year = YearStyle()\n    public var list = ListViewStyle()\n    public var locale = Locale.current\n    public var calendar = Calendar.current\n    public var timezone = TimeZone.current\n    public var defaultType: CalendarType?\n    public var timeHourSystem: TimeHourSystem = .twentyFourHour\n    public var startWeekDay: StartDayType = .monday\n    public var followInSystemTheme: Bool = false \n    public var systemCalendars: Set<String> = []\n}\n```\n\n## Author\n\n[Sergei Kviatkovskii](https://github.com/kvyatkovskys)\n\n## License\n\nKVKCalendar is available under the [MIT license](https://github.com/kvyatkovskys/KVKCalendar/blob/master/LICENSE.md)\n"

This also means that Periphery will be built using the same build configuration you specify to build your entire project (the default is 'debug'). Debug builds of Periphery are significantly slower than release builds.\n\n### [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) (macOS only)\n\nAdd the following to your Podfile:\n\n```\npod 'Periphery'\n```\n\nNow run `pod install`, the Periphery executable will be downloaded and placed at `Pods/Periphery/periphery`.\n\n## How To Use\n\n### The `scan` Command\n\nThe scan command is Periphery's primary function. To begin a guided setup, simply change to your project directory and run:\n\n```\nperiphery scan --setup\n```\n\nAfter answering a few questions, Periphery will print out the full scan command and execute it.\n\nThe guided setup is only intended for introductory purposes, once you are familiar with Periphery you can try some more advanced options, all of which can be seen with `periphery help scan`.\n\nTo get coherent results from Periphery, it's crucial to understand the implications of the build targets you choose to analyze. For example, imagine a project consisting of three targets: App, Lib and Tests. The App target imports Lib, and the Tests targets imports both App and Lib. If you were to provide all three to the `--targets` option then Periphery will be able to analyze your project as a whole. However, if you only choose to analyze App and Lib, but not Tests, Periphery may report some instances of unused code that are _only_ referenced by Tests. Therefore when you suspect Periphery has provided an incorrect result, it's important to consider the targets that you have chosen to analyze.\n\nIf your project consists of one or more standalone frameworks that do not also contain some kind of application that consume their interfaces, then you'll need to tell Periphery to assume that all public declarations are in fact used by including the `--retain-public` option.\n\nFor projects that are mixed Objective-C & Swift, it's highly recommend you [read about the implications](#objective-c) this can have on your results.\n\n### Configuration\n\nOnce you've settled upon the appropriate options for your project, you may wish to persist them in a YAML configuration file. The simplest way to achieve this is to run Periphery with the `--verbose` option. Near the beginning of the output you will see the `[configuration:begin]` section with your configuration formatted as YAML below. Copy & paste the configuration into `.periphery.yml` in the root of your project folder. You can now simply run `periphery scan` and the YAML configuration will be used.\n\n## How It Works\n\nPeriphery first builds your project. For Xcode projects the schemes provided via the `--schemes` option are built using `xcodebuild`. For Swift Package Manager projects, the individual targets provided via the `--targets` option are built using `swift build`. The Swift compiler employs a technique called index-while-building to populate an index store that contains information about the structure of your project's source code.\n\nAfter your project is built, Periphery performs an indexing phase. For every source file that is a member of the targets provided via the `--targets` option, Periphery obtains its structural information from the index store and builds its own internal graph representation of your project. Periphery also analyzes each file's abstract syntax tree (AST) to fill in some details not provided by the index store.\n\nOnce indexing is complete, Periphery analyzes the graph to identify unused code. This phase consists of a number of steps that mutate the graph to make it easier to identify specific scenarios of unused code. The final step walks the graph from its roots to identify declarations that are no longer referenced.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe goal of Periphery is to report instances of unused _declarations_. A declaration is a `class`, `struct`, `protocol`, `function`, `property`, `constructor`, `enum`, `typealias`, `associatedtype`, etc. As you'd expect, Periphery is able to identify simple unreferenced declarations, e.g a `class` that is no longer used anywhere in your codebase.\n\nPeriphery can also identify more advanced instances of unused code. The following section explains these in detail.\n\n### Function Parameters\n\nPeriphery can identify unused function parameters. Instances of unused parameters can also be identified in protocols and their conforming declarations, as well as parameters in overridden methods. Both of these scenarios are explained further below.\n\n#### Protocols\n\nAn unused parameter of a protocol function will only be reported as unused if the parameter is also unused in all implementations.\n\n```swift\nprotocol Greeter {\n    func greet(name: String)\n    func farewell(name: String) // 'name' is unused\n}\n\nclass InformalGreeter: Greeter {\n    func greet(name: String) {\n        print(\"Sup \" + name + \".\")\n    }\n\n    func farewell(name: String) { // 'name' is unused\n      print(\"Cya.\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n> **Tip**\n>\n> You can ignore all unused parameters from protocols and conforming functions with the `--retain-unused-protocol-func-params` option.\n\n#### Overrides\n\nSimilar to protocols, parameters of overridden functions are only reported as unused if they're also unused in the base function and all overriding functions.\n\n```swift\nclass BaseGreeter {\n    func greet(name: String) {\n        print(\"Hello.\")\n    }\n\n    func farewell(name: String) { // 'name' is unused\n        print(\"Goodbye.\")\n    }\n}\n\nclass InformalGreeter: BaseGreeter {\n    override func greet(name: String) {\n        print(\"Sup \" + name + \".\")\n    }\n\n    override func farewell(name: String) { // 'name' is unused\n        print(\"Cya.\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Foreign Protocols & Classes\n\nUnused parameters of protocols or classes defined in foreign modules (e.g Foundation) are always ignored, since you do not have access to modify the base function declaration.\n\n#### fatalError Functions\n\nUnused parameters of functions that simply call `fatalError` are also ignored. Such functions are often unimplemented required initializers in subclasses.\n\n```swift\nclass Base {\n    let param: String\n\n    required init(param: String) {\n        self.param = param\n    }\n}\n\nclass Subclass: Base {\n    init(custom: String) {\n        super.init(param: custom)\n    }\n\n    required init(param: String) {\n        fatalError(\"init(param:) has not been implemented\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Protocols\n\nA protocol which is conformed to by an object is not truly used unless it's also used as an existential type, or to specialize a generic method/class. Periphery is able to identify such redundant protocols whether they are conformed to by one, or even multiple objects.\n\n```swift\nprotocol MyProtocol { // 'MyProtocol' is redundant\n    func someMethod()\n}\n\nclass MyClass1: MyProtocol { // 'MyProtocol' conformance is redundant\n    func someMethod() {\n        print(\"Hello from MyClass1!\")\n    }\n}\n\nclass MyClass2: MyProtocol { // 'MyProtocol' conformance is redundant\n    func someMethod() {\n        print(\"Hello from MyClass2!\")\n    }\n}\n\nlet myClass1 = MyClass1()\nmyClass1.someMethod()\n\nlet myClass2 = MyClass2()\nmyClass2.someMethod()\n```\n\nHere we can see that despite both implementations of `someMethod` are called, at no point does an object take on the type of `MyProtocol`. Therefore the protocol itself is redundant, and there's no benefit from `MyClass1` or `MyClass2` conforming to it. We can remove `MyProtocol` along with each redundant conformance, and just keep `someMethod` in each class.\n\nJust like a normal method or property of a object, individual properties and methods declared by your protocol can also be identified as unused.\n\n```swift\nprotocol MyProtocol {\n    var usedProperty: String { get }\n    var unusedProperty: String { get } // 'unusedProperty' is unused\n}\n\nclass MyConformingClass: MyProtocol {\n    var usedProperty: String = \"used\"\n    var unusedProperty: String = \"unused\" // 'unusedProperty' is unused\n}\n\nclass MyClass {\n    let conformingClass: MyProtocol\n\n    init() {\n        conformingClass = MyConformingClass()\n    }\n\n    func perform() {\n        print(conformingClass.usedProperty)\n    }\n}\n\nlet myClass = MyClass()\nmyClass.perform()\n```\n\nHere we can see that `MyProtocol` is itself used, and cannot be removed. However, since `unusedProperty` is never called on `MyConformingClass`, Periphery is able to identify that the declaration of `unusedProperty` in `MyProtocol` is also unused and can be removed along with the unused implementation of `unusedProperty`.\n\n### Enumerations\n\nAlong with being able to identify unused enumerations, Periphery can also identify individual unused enum cases. Plain enums that are not raw representable, i.e that _don't_ have a `String`, `Character`, `Int` or floating-point value type can be reliably identified. However, enumerations that _do_ have a raw value type can be dynamic in nature, and therefore must be assumed to be used.\n\nLet's clear this up with a quick example:\n\n```swift\nenum MyEnum: String {\n    case myCase\n}\n\nfunc someFunction(value: String) {\n    if let myEnum = MyEnum(rawValue: value) {\n        somethingImportant(myEnum)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThere's no direct reference to the `myCase` case, so it's reasonable to expect it _might_ no longer be needed, however if it were removed we can see that `somethingImportant` would never be called if `someFunction` were passed the value of `\"myCase\"`.\n\n### Assign-only Properties\n\nProperties that are assigned but never used are identified as such, e.g:\n\n```swift\nclass MyClass {\n    var assignOnlyProperty: String // 'assignOnlyProperty' is assigned, but never used\n\n    init(value: String) {\n        self.assignOnlyProperty = value\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn some cases this may be the intended behavior, therefore you have a few options available to silence such results:\n* Retain individual properties using [Comment Commands](#comment-commands).\n* Retain all assign-only properties by their type with `--retain-assign-only-property-types`. Given types must match their exact usage in the property declaration (sans optional question mark), e.g `String`, `[String]`, `Set<String>`. Periphery is unable to resolve inferred property types, therefore in some instances you may need to add explicit type annotations to your properties.\n* Disable assign-only property analysis entirely with `--retain-assign-only-properties`.\n\n### Redundant Public Accessibility\n\nDeclarations that are marked `public` yet are not referenced from outside their home module, are identified as having redundant public accessibility. In this scenario, the `public` annotation can be removed from the declaration. Removing redundant public accessibility has a couple of benefits:\n* It helps reduce the public surface area of your modules.\n* In [Whole Module Compilation](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/OptimizationTips.rst#whole-module-optimizations-wmo) mode, Swift can infer `final` by [automatically discovering](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/OptimizationTips.rst#advice-if-wmo-is-enabled-use-internal-when-a-declaration-does-not-need-to-be-accessed-outside-of-module) all potentially overriding declarations. `final` classes are [better optimized](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/OptimizationTips.rst#advice-use-final-when-you-know-the-declaration-does-not-need-to-be-overridden) by the compiler.\n\nThis analysis can be disabled with `--disable-redundant-public-analysis`.\n\n### Objective-C\n\nPeriphery cannot analyze Objective-C code since types may be dynamically typed.\n\nBy default Periphery does not assume that declarations accessible by the Objective-C runtime are in use. If your project is a mix of Swift & Objective-C, you can enable this behavior with the `--retain-objc-accessible` option. Swift declarations that are accessible by the Objective-C runtime are those that are explicitly attributed with `@objc` or `@objcMembers`, and classes that inherit `NSObject` either directly or indirectly via another class.\n\n### Encodable\n\nConformance to `Encodable` (inc. implicitly via `Codable`) causes synthesis of additional code not visible to Periphery, and thus Periphery is unable to determine if the properties of conforming types are referenced from synthesized code. Therefore, all such properties must be retained in order to avoid false-positive results in the situation where the properties are only referenced via the initializer. For example:\n\n```swift\nstruct SomeStruct: Encodable {\n    let someProperty: String // Not unused, automatically retained.\n}\nlet data = try JSONEncoder().encode(SomeStruct(someProperty: \"value\"))\n```\n\nThis property retention behavior is automatic, even when `Encodable` conformance is inherited via another protocol. However, if a protocol that inherits `Encodable` is declared in an external module that Periphery has not analyzed, it cannot detect the inheritance of `Encodable`. In this situation you can use the `--external-encodable-protocols` option enable this behavior for the given protocols.\n\n## Comment Commands\n\nFor whatever reason, you may want to keep some unused code. Source code comment commands can be used to ignore specific declarations, and exclude them from the results.\n\nAn ignore comment command can be placed directly on the line above any declaration to ignore it, and all descendent declarations:\n\n```swift\n// periphery:ignore\nclass MyClass {}\n```\n\nYou can also ignore specific unused function parameters:\n\n```swift\n// periphery:ignore:parameters unusedOne,unusedTwo\nfunc someFunc(used: String, unusedOne: String, unusedTwo: String) {\n    print(used)\n}\n```\n\nThe `// periphery:ignore:all` command can be placed at the top of the source file to ignore the entire contents of the file. Note that the comment must be placed above any code, including import statements.\n\n## Xcode Integration\n\nBefore setting up Xcode integration, we highly recommend you first get Periphery working in a terminal, as you will be using the exact same command via Xcode.\n\n### Step 1: Create an Aggregate Target\n\nSelect your project in the Project Navigator and click the + button at the bottom left of the Targets section. Select **Cross-platform** and choose **Aggregate**. Hit Next.\n\n![Step 1](assets/xcode-integration/1.png)\n\nChoose a name for the new target, e.g \"Periphery\" or \"Unused Code\".\n\n![Step 2](assets/xcode-integration/2.png)\n\n### Step 2: Add a Run Script Build Phase\n\nIn the **Build Phases** section click the + button to add a new Run Script phase.\n\n![Step 3](assets/xcode-integration/3.png)\n\nIn the shell script window enter the Periphery command. Be sure to include the `--format xcode` option.\n\n![Step 4](assets/xcode-integration/4.png)\n\n### Step 3: Select & Run\n\nYou're ready to roll. You should now see the new scheme in the dropdown. Select it and hit run.\n\n> **Tip**\n>\n> If you'd like others on your team to be able to use the scheme, you'll need to mark it as _Shared_. This can be done by selecting _Manage Schemes..._ and selecting the _Shared_ checkbox next to the new scheme. The scheme definition can now be checked into source control.\n\n![Step 5](assets/xcode-integration/5.png)\n\n## Excluding Files\n\nBoth exclusion options described below accept a Bash v4 style path glob, either absolute or relative to your project directory. You may specify multiple globs by separating them with a pipe character, e.g `\"Sources/Single.swift|**/Generated/*.swift|**/*.{xib,storyboard}\"`.\n\n### Excluding Results\n\nTo exclude the results from certain files, pass the `--report-exclude <globs>` option to the `scan` command.\n\n### Excluding Indexed Files\n\nTo exclude files from being indexed, pass the `--index-exclude <globs>` option to the `scan` command. Excluding files from the index phase means that any declarations and references contained within the files will not be seen by Periphery. Periphery will be behave as if the files do not exist. For example, this option can be used to exclude generated code that holds references to non-generated code, or exclude all `.xib` and `.storyboard` files that hold references to code.\n\n## Continuous Integration\n\nWhen integrating Periphery into a CI pipeline, you can potentially skip the build phase if your pipeline has already done so, e.g to run tests. This can be achieved using the `--skip-build` option. However, you also need to tell Periphery the location of the index store using `--index-store-path`. This location is dependent on your project type.\n\nNote that when using `--skip-build` and `--index-store-path` it's vital that the index store contains data for all of the targets you specify via `--targets`. For example, if your pipeline previously built the targets 'App' and 'Lib', the index store will only contain data for the files in those targets. You cannot then instruct Periphery to scan additional targets, e.g 'Extension', or 'UnitTests'.\n\n### Xcode\n\nThe index store generated by `xcodebuild` exists in DerivedData at a location dependent on your project, e.g `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/YourProject-abc123/Index/DataStore`.\n\n### SwiftPM\n\nBy default Periphery, looks for the index store at `.build/debug/index/store`. Therefore, if you intend to run Periphery directly after calling `swift test`, you can omit the `--index-store-path` option, and Periphery will use the index store created when the project was built for testing. However if this isn't the case, then you must provide Periphery the location of the index store with `--index-store-path`.\n\n## Platforms\n\nPeriphery supports both macOS and Linux. macOS supports both Xcode and Swift Package Manager (SPM) projects, whereas only SPM projects are supported on Linux.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Erroneous results in one or more files, such as false-positives and incorrect source file locations\n\nIt's possible for the index store to become corrupt, or out of sync with the source file. This can happen, for example, if you forcefully terminate (^C) a scan. To rectify this, you can pass the `--clean-build` flag to the scan command to force removal of existing build artifacts.\n\n### Code referenced within preprocessor macro conditional branch is unused\n\nWhen Periphery builds your project it uses the default build configuration, which is typically 'debug'. If you use preprocessor macros to conditionally compile code, Periphery will only have visibility into the branches that are compiled. In the example below, `releaseName` will be reported as unused as it is only referenced within the non-debug branch of the macro.\n\n```swift\nstruct BuildInfo {\n    let debugName = \"debug\"\n    let releaseName = \"release\" // 'releaseName' is unused\n\n    var name: String {\n        #if DEBUG\n        debugName\n        #else\n        releaseName\n        #endif\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou've a few options to workaround this:\n - Use [Comment Commands](#comment-commands) to explicitly ignore `releaseName`.\n - Filter the results to remove known instances.\n - Run Periphery once for each build configuration and merge the results. You can pass arguments to the underlying build by specifying them after `--`, e.g `periphery scan ... -- -configuration release`.\n\n## Known Bugs\n\nDue to some underlying bugs in Swift, Periphery may in some instances report incorrect results. You can encourage Apple to fix these issues by voting for them on the Swift JIRA.\n\n| ID    | Title | Fixed in Swift 5.6 |\n| :---  | :---  | :---:              |\n| [SR-13766](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13766) | Index store does not correctly relate variable type | \u2705 |\n| [SR-14181](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-14181) | Index store does not relate constructor referenced via Self | |\n| [SR-14162](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-14162) | Index store does not relate static property getter used as subscript key | |\n| [SR-13930](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13930) | Index store does not relate objc optional protocol method implemented in subclass | |\n| [SR-13792](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13792) | Index store should relate appendInterpolation from string literals | |\n| [SR-13768](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13768) | Index store does not relate constructor via literal notation | |\n| [SR-13767](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13767) | Index store reference occurrence incorrectly related for lazy variable | |\n| [SR-7093](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-7093) | Index does not include reference to constructor of class/struct with generic types | |\n"

Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**\n\nIf you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.\n\nInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.\n\nYou don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.\n\n## Learn More\n\nYou can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).\n\nTo learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).\n\n### Code Splitting\n\nThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting)\n\n### Analyzing the Bundle Size\n\nThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size)\n\n### Making a Progressive Web App\n\nThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app)\n\n### Advanced Configuration\n\nThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration)\n\n### Deployment\n\nThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)\n\n### `npm run build` fails to minify\n\nThis section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify)\n"

At\nthe moment, the package consists mostly of an interface to the\n[array-oriented functions](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/vecLib/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000414-357225),\nwhich provide a vectorised form of many common mathematical functions, however the package does provide access to several other vectorized operations and more are being added on a regular basis.   In\ngeneral, the performance is significantly better than using standard libm\nfunctions, though there does appear to be some reduced accuracy.\n\nThe following functions are supported:\n * *Rounding*: `ceil`, `floor`, `trunc`, `round`\n * *Logarithmic*: `exp`, `exp2`, `expm1`, `log`, `log1p`, `log2`, `log10`\n * *Trigonometric*: `sin`, `sinpi`, `cos`, `cospi`, `tan`, `tanpi`, `asin`, `acos`, `atan`, `atan2`, `cis`\n * *Hyperbolic*: `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`, `asinh`, `acosh`, `atanh`\n * *Convolution*: `conv`, `xcorr`\n * *Other*: `sqrt`, `copysign`, `exponent`, `abs`, `rem`\n\nNote there are some slight differences from behaviour in Base:\n * No `DomainError`s are raised, instead `NaN` values are returned.\n * `round` breaks ties (values with a fractional part of 0.5) by choosing the\n   nearest even value.\n * `exponent` returns a floating point value of the same type (instead of an `Int`).\n\nSome additional functions that are also available:\n* `rec(x)`: reciprocal (`1.0 ./ x`)\n* `rsqrt(x)`: reciprocal square-root (`1.0 ./ sqrt(x)`)\n* `pow(x,y)`: power (`x .^ y` in Base)\n* `fdiv(x,y)`: divide (`x ./ y` in Base)\n* `sincos(x)`: returns `(sin(x), cos(x))`\n\n## Example\n\nTo avoid naming conflicts with Base, methods are not exported and so need to\nbe accessed via the namespace:\n```julia\nusing AppleAccelerate\nusing BenchmarkTools\nX = randn(1_000_000);\n@btime exp.($X); # standard libm function\n@btime AppleAccelerate.exp($X); # Accelerate array-oriented function\n```\n\nThe `@replaceBase` macro replaces the relevant Base methods directly\n```julia\n@btime sin.($X); # standard libm function\nAppleAccelerate.@replaceBase sin cos tan\n@btime sin($X);  # will use AppleAccelerate methods for vectorised operations\n\nX = randn(1_000_000);\nY = fill(3.0, 1_000_000);\n@btime $X .^ $Y;\nAppleAccelerate.@replaceBase(^, /) # use parenthesised form for infix ops\n@btime $X ^ $Y;\n```\n\nOutput arrays can be specified as first arguments of the functions suffixed\nwith `!`:\n```julia\nout = zeros(Float64, 1_000_000)\n@btime AppleAccelerate.exp!($out, $X)\n```\n\n**Warning**: no dimension checks are performed on the `!` functions, so ensure\n  your input and output arrays are of the same length.\n\nOperations can be performed in-place by specifying the output array as the\ninput array (e.g. `AppleAccelerate.exp!(X,X)`). This is not mentioned in the\nAccelerate docs, but [this comment](http://stackoverflow.com/a/28833191/392585) by one of the authors indicates that it is safe.\n"

  "readme_contents": "# [Node.js] Sign in with Apple \n\nNode.JS wrapper around [Sign in with Apple REST API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplerestapi).\n\nThis module lets you authenticate users using Apple account in your Node.js application.\n\n## Prerequisites\n1. You should be enrolled in [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/).\n2. Please have a look at [Apple documentation](\nhttps://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/get-started/) related to \"Sign in with Apple\" feature.\n3. You should create App ID and Service ID in your Apple Developer Account.\n4. You should generate private key for your Service ID in your Apple Developer Account.\n\nMore detail about configuration can be found in [blog post](https://medium.com/@artyomefremov/add-sign-in-with-apple-button-to-your-website-today-part-1-12ed1444623a?postPublishedType=initial) and [Apple docs](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/dev1c0e25352).\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the module using [npm](http://npmjs.com):\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save apple-signin\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### 1. Get authorization URL\nStart \"Sign in with Apple\" flow by redirecting user to the authorization URL.\n```javascript\nconst appleSignin = require(\"apple-signin\");\n\nconst options = {\n    clientID: \"com.gotechmakers.auth.client\", // identifier of Apple Service ID.\n    redirectUri: \"http://localhost:3000/auth/apple/callback\",\n    state: \"123\", // optional, An unguessable random string. It is primarily used to protect against CSRF attacks.\n    scope: \"email\" // optional, default value is \"email\".\n};\n\nconst authorizationUrl = appleSignin.getAuthorizationUrl(options);\n```\nAlternatively, you can use [Sign In with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplejs) browser javascript library.\n\n### 2. Get access token\n2.1. Retrieve \"code\" query param from URL string when user is redirected to your site after successful sign in with Apple. Example:\nhttp://localhost:3000/auth/apple/callback?code=somecode&state=123.\n\n2.2. Exchange retrieved \"code\" to user's access token.\n\nMore detail can be found in [Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplerestapi/generate_and_validate_tokens).\n\n```javascript\n\nconst clientSecret = appleSignin.getClientSecret({\n    clientID: \"com.gotechmakers.auth.client\", // identifier of Apple Service ID.\n    teamId: \"teamId\", // Apple Developer Team ID.\n    privateKeyPath: \"/var/www/app/AuthKey_XXX.p8\", // path to private key associated with your client ID.\n    keyIdentifier: \"XXX\" // identifier of the private key.    \n});\n\nconst options = {\n    clientID: \"com.gotechmakers.auth.client\", // identifier of Apple Service ID.\n    redirectUri: \"http://localhost:3000/auth/apple/callback\", // use the same value which you passed to authorisation URL.\n    clientSecret: clientSecret\n};\n \nappleSignin.getAuthorizationToken(code, options).then(tokenResponse => {\n    console.log(tokenResponse);\n}).catch(error => {\n    console.log(error);\n});\n```\n\nResult of ```getAuthorizationToken``` command is a JSON object representing Apple's [TokenResponse](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplerestapi/tokenresponse):\n```javascript\n{\n    access_token: \"ACCESS_TOKEN\", // A token used to access allowed data.\n    token_type: 'Bearer', // It will always be Bearer.\n    expires_in: 3600, // The amount of time, in seconds, before the access token expires.\n    refresh_token: \"REFRESH_TOKEN\", // used to regenerate new access tokens. Store this token securely on your server.\n    id_token: \"ID_TOKEN\" // A JSON Web Token that contains the user\u2019s identity information.\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Verify token signature and get unique user's identifier\n```javascript\nappleSignin.verifyIdToken(tokenResponse.id_token, clientID).then(result => {\n    const userAppleId = result.sub;\n}).catch(error => {\n    // Token is not verified\n    console.log(error);\n});\n```\n### 4. Refresh access token after expiration\n```javascript\n\nconst clientSecret = appleSignin.getClientSecret({\n    clientID: \"com.gotechmakers.auth.client\", // identifier of Apple Service ID.\n    teamId: \"teamId\", // Apple Developer Team ID.\n    privateKeyPath: \"/var/www/app/AuthKey_XXX.p8\", // path to private key associated with your client ID.\n    keyIdentifier: \"XXX\" // identifier of the private key.    \n});\n\nconst options = {\n    clientID: \"com.gotechmakers.auth.client\", // identifier of Apple Service ID.\n    clientSecret: clientSecret\n};\n \nappleSignin.refreshAuthorizationToken(refreshToken, options).then(result => {\n    const newAccessToken = result.access_token;\n}).catch(error => {\n    console.log(error);\n})\n```\n\n## Examples\nDevelopers using the popular [Express](http://expressjs.com) web framework can refer to an [example](https://github.com/Techofficer/express-apple-signin) as a starting point for their own web applications. \n\nYou can also check [live example](http://apple-auth.gotechmakers.com)\n\n## Contributing\nPull requests are welcome.

It has an HTTP server that has an API that allows fetching and uploading of content from the server.\n\n## Research\n\n* [Signature](signature/README.md)\n* [Locator Service](locator/README.md)\n* [Cache Server API](server/README.md)\n\nAdditionally, packet captures are provided in the `captures` directory.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe work here was done by using [Charles Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/) and [Frida](https://www.frida.re/).\n\nThe `tools/frida-ssl-pin.js` file is a Frida script that can attach to any macOS process and disable all SSL verification and SSL certificate pinning. This has allowed me to deeply examine the requests going to Apple's servers. This script is likely useful\nfor many other use cases. If anyone else uses it, I'd love to hear about how it was used (I'm a super huge nerd and am quite interested in reverse engineering).\nNote that SIP will need to be disabled in order to correctly use it.\n\nI also have a modified Frida Python script which targets `launchd` to inject the SSL pinning and verification disable script.\nSince `AssetCache` is spawned by launchd, you can attach Frida to launchd, and wait\nspawn `AssetCache` via the service. The script is located at: `tools/frida-ssl-pin-target.py`, just do `pip3 install frida frida-tools` and run the script.\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Apple Music Animation\n\n## Overview\nThis demo emulates the animation of the circles which are present in Apple Music iOS app. Unfortunately, Apple Music Android\napp doesn't come with such animations. So i tried my hands and made it for Android. The initial version of the animation\ncovers the most important functionalities of that.\n\n## Demo\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzkK9rtabZw\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/lzkK9rtabZw/maxresdefault.jpg\" border=\"10\" /></a>\n\n## GIF demo\nThe above video link is a high resolution demo for the animation. In case you dont want to redirect to that demo, here is a\nGIF demo that will play in here, but it has a low frame rate. I didn't find any tool to convert a high quality video into\na GIF with a high frame rate.\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ![](animation_demo.gif)\n\n## How is this made?\nFew libraies that helped me enormously in making this animation is\n1. [Box2d](https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D)  by Erin Catto. Although this library is very huge and it covers all the\ndifferent aspects of simulating the real world physics in programming world, i was able to make this animation by using only\na handful of its APIs. Box2d is the most popular physics engine in the world. It contains APIs for almost everything that we\nwant to simulate like Collision, contacts between bodies, radial gravity. Box2d forms the basis of many game engines like\nCocos2d, which also involves the rendering engine in itself.\n\n2. [JBox2D Demo](https://github.com/HaydnTrigg/JBox2D-Demo) by Hadyn Trigg. JBox2d is actually the Java code of Box2d plus\nsome additional APIs. I didn't know how to render the objects on screen in Android when i started with Box2d. The rendering\nengine in the animation is based out on this demo app.\n\n3. [JOML](https://github.com/JOML-CI/JOML) This is the Java OpenGL Mathematics library is used to calculate matrices for OpenGL that OpenGL shaders can use to draw geometry to the screen. Its also bundled in the JBox2d demo.\n\n\nI will be publishing a blog regarding how this animaton is made and what all conecpts of physics goes into this. Please watch\nout my [medium blog](https://medium.com/@rahulraja) and my [personal blog](http://rahulrj.github.io/).\n\n\n## Next Release\n1. Click to enlarge the circles\n2. Reset Animation\n3. Swirl animation of the circles while they move.\n4. And of course a blog regarding this.\n"

  "readme_contents": "# In-app purchase verification\n\nInspired by the [iap_verifier](https://github.com/pcrawfor/iap_verifier/) CoffeeScript module\nwritten by Paul Crawford, I wanted a pure JavaScript implementation of in-app purchase verification.\nI also wanted to add support for other app stores, and not just limit this to Apple. The `iap`\nmodule is exactly that. Pull requests to add support for other platforms are very welcome!\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install iap\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Initialisation\n\n```javascript\nvar iap = require('iap');\n\nvar platform = 'apple';\nvar payment = {\n\treceipt: 'receipt data', // always required\n\tproductId: 'abc',\n\tpackageName: 'my.app',\n\tsecret: 'password',\n\tsubscription: true,\t// optional, if google play subscription\n\tkeyObject: {}, // required, if google\n\tuserId: 'user id', // required, if amazon\n\tdevToken: 'developer id' // required, if roku\n};\n```\n\n### Purchase verification ( all platforms )\n\nA method is exposed to verify purchase receipts:\n\n```javascript\niap.verifyPayment(platform, payment, function (error, response) {\n\t/* your code */\n});\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer a promise-based alternative: \n\n```javascript\niap.verifyPayment(platform, payment)\n.then(\n    response => {\t\n        /* your code */ \n    },\n    error => {\n        /* your code */ \n    }\n)\n```\n\nThe receipt you pass must conform to the requirements of the backend you are verifying with. Read\nthe next chapter for more information on the format.\n\n### Subscription cancellation ( Google Play only )\n\nGoogle exposes [an API for server side cancellation](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/api-ref/purchases/subscriptions/cancel) of recurring suscriptions. This might be\nbe used to enable users to easily cancel subscriptions from within the app ( without going\nto Play Store ), or to allow subscriptions to be canceled by support people when users request\nit ( when for some reason the users are unable or unwilling to do so themselves).\n\n```javascript\niap.cancelSubscription(\"google\", payment, function (error, response) {\n\t/* your code */\n});\n```\n\nOr, if you prefer a promise-based alternative: \n\n```javascript\niap.cancelSubscription(platform, payment)\n.then(\n    response => {    \n        /* your code */ \n    },\n    error => {\n        /* your code */ \n    }\n)\n```\n\n## Supported platforms\n\n### Amazon\n\n**The payment object**\n\nThe receipt string represents the transaction returned from a channel or product\npurchase.\n\nA Shared secret and user ID is required.\n\n**The response**\n\nThe response passed back to your callback will also be Amazon specific. The entire parsed receipt\nwill be in the result object:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"receipt\": {\n\t\t\"betaProduct\": false,\n\t\t\"cancelDate\": null,\n\t\t\"parentProductId\": null,\n\t\t\"productId\": \"com.amazon.iapsamplev2.gold_medal\",\n\t\t\"productType\": \"CONSUMABLE\",\n\t\t\"purchaseDate\": 1399070221749,\n\t\t\"quantity\": 1,\n\t\t\"receiptId\": \"wE1EG1gsEZI9q9UnI5YoZ2OxeoVKPdR5bvPMqyKQq5Y=:1:11\",\n\t\t\"renewalDate\": null,\n\t\t\"term\": null,\n\t\t\"termSku\": null,\n\t\t\"testTransaction\": false\n\t},\n\t\"transactionId\": \"wE1EG1gsEZI9q9UnI5YoZ2OxeoVKPdR5bvPMqyKQq5Y=:1:11\",\n\t\"productId\": \"com.amazon.iapsamplev2.gold_medal\",\n\t\"platform\": \"amazon\"\n}\n```\n\n### Apple\n\n**The payment object**\n\nThe receipt string passed may be either the base64 string that Apple really wants, or the decoded\nreceipt as returned by the iOS SDK (in which case it will be automatically base64 serialized).\n\nBoth productId and packageName (bundle ID) are optional, but when provided will be tested against.\nIf the receipt does not match the provided values, an error will be returned.\n\nTo verify auto-renewable subscriptions you need to provide `secret` field that\ncontains your In-App Purchase Shared Secret\n\nApple supports returning only the most recent transaction for auto-renewable subscriptions via their [exclude-old-transactions](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Chapters/ValidateRemotely.html) option. This can greatly save on bandwidth for users that have more than one transaction. To enable this, pass `excludeOldTransactions` on the payment object:\n\n```javascript\nlet payment = {\n  ...\n  excludeOldTransactions: true\n}\n```\n\n**The response**\n\nThe response passed back to your callback will also be Apple specific. The entire parsed receipt\nwill be in the result object. Applications that support monthly and yearly\nsubscription access will represent auto-renewable terms in either the `in_app`\nor `latestReceiptInfo` property.\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"receipt\": {\n\t\t\"original_purchase_date_pst\": \"2016-10-29 15:46:57 America/Los_Angeles\",\n\t\t\"purchase_date_ms\": \"1477802802000\",\n\t\t\"unique_identifier\": \"78abf2209323434771637ee22f0ee8b8341f14b4\",\n\t\t\"original_transaction_id\": \"120000257973875\",\n\t\t\"bvrs\": \"0.0.1\",\n\t\t\"transaction_id\": \"120000265421254\",\n\t\t\"quantity\": \"1\",\n\t\t\"unique_vendor_identifier\": \"206FED24-2EAB-4FC6-B946-4AF61086DF21\",\n\t\t\"item_id\": \"820817285\",\n\t\t\"product_id\": \"abc\",\n\t\t\"purchase_date\": \"2016-10-29 22:46:57 Etc/GMT\",\n\t\t\"original_purchase_date\": \"2016-10-29 22:46:57 Etc/GMT\",\n\t\t\"purchase_date_pst\": \"2016-10-29 15:46:57 America/Los_Angeles\",\n\t\t\"bid\": \"test.myapp\",\n\t\t\"original_purchase_date_ms\": \"1477781217000\",\n\t\t\"in_app\": [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\"quantity\": \"1\",\n\t\t\t\t\"product_id\": \"abc\",\n\t\t\t\t\"transaction_id\": \"120000265421254\",\n\t\t\t\t\"original_transaction_id\": \"120000257973875\",\n\t\t\t\t\"purchase_date\": \"2016-10-30 04:46:42 Etc/GMT\",\n\t\t\t\t\"purchase_date_ms\": \"1477802802000\",\n\t\t\t\t\"purchase_date_pst\": \"2016-10-29 21:46:42 America/Los_Angeles\",\n\t\t\t\t\"original_purchase_date\": \"2016-10-29 22:46:57 Etc/GMT\",\n\t\t\t\t\"original_purchase_date_ms\": \"1477781217000\",\n\t\t\t\t\"original_purchase_date_pst\": \"2016-10-29 15:46:57 America/Los_Angeles\",\n\t\t\t\t\"expires_date\": \"2016-11-30 05:46:42 Etc/GMT\",\n\t\t\t\t\"expires_date_ms\": \"1480484802000\",\n\t\t\t\t\"expires_date_pst\": \"2016-11-29 21:46:42 America/Los_Angeles\",\n\t\t\t\t\"web_order_line_item_id\": \"820817285\",\n\t\t\t\t\"is_trial_period\": \"false\"\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t]\n\t},\n\t\"latestReceiptInfo\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"quantity\": \"1\",\n\t\t\t\"product_id\": \"abc\",\n\t\t\t\"transaction_id\": \"120000233230473\",\n\t\t\t\"original_transaction_id\": \"120000233230473\",\n\t\t\t\"purchase_date\": \"2016-06-12 22:36:58 Etc/GMT\",\n\t\t\t\"purchase_date_ms\": \"1465771018000\",\n\t\t\t\"purchase_date_pst\": \"2016-06-12 15:36:58 America/Los_Angeles\",\n\t\t\t\"original_purchase_date\": \"2016-06-12 22:36:58 Etc/GMT\",\n\t\t\t\"original_purchase_date_ms\": \"1465771018000\",\n\t\t\t\"original_purchase_date_pst\": \"2016-06-12 15:36:58 America/Los_Angeles\",\n\t\t\t\"expires_date\": \"2016-07-12 22:36:58 Etc/GMT\",\n\t\t\t\"expires_date_ms\": \"1468363018000\",\n\t\t\t\"expires_date_pst\": \"2016-07-12 15:36:58 America/Los_Angeles\",\n\t\t\t\"web_order_line_item_id\": \"120000034778618\",\n\t\t\t\"is_trial_period\": \"true\"\n\t\t},\n\t],\n\t\"pendingRenewalInfo\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t  \"expiration_intent\": \"1\",\n \t\t\t\"auto_renew_product_id\": \"abc\",\n\t\t\t\"original_transaction_id\": \"120000233230473\",\n\t\t\t\"is_in_billing_retry_period\": \"0\",\n\t\t\t\"product_id\": \"abc\",\n\t\t\t\"auto_renew_status\": \"0\"\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"transactionId\": \"120000233230473\",\n\t\"productId\": \"abc\",\n\t\"platform\": \"apple\",\n\t\"environment\": \"production\"\n}\n```\n\n### Google Play\n\n**The payment object**\n\nThe receipt string is the purchase token that Google Play returns to the mobile application when a purchase is made.\n\nBoth packageName and productId are compulsory.\n\nLastly you must provide `keyObject` which is the Google API Service Account JSON key file linked to your Google Play\naccount for authentication.

It is aimed at merchants or PSPs that are looking to manage their own Apple Pay flow, as opposed to letting a third-party (such as Stripe) do it end-to-end. You will need a paid Apple Developer account to use this.\n\nNote: we have included the Apple root CA in this repository. For production use-cases, you should always download the certificates directly from [Apple](https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/).\n\n## Running tests\n\n```shell\ngo test\n```\n\nYou may need to change your `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` to include OpenSSL. For example, on my Mac I use `PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib/pkgconfig go test`.\n\n## Getting up and running with the example\n\nRequirements:\n- An account in the Apple Developer Program\n- A recent version of Go (tested with v1.9.2)\n- [`cfssl`](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl)\n- OpenSSL/libssl-dev\n- make\n\n1. Log into your developer account. [In the developer console](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifier/merchant), create a Merchant ID\n\n1. Verify your domain by serving the `apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association` file at `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association` (the example app will do it for you if you put it in `example/static/.well-known`).\n**Note**: Be careful to support one of the [supported cipher suites](https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs#2166536) for HTTPS!\n\n1. Edit the JSON files in the `certs/` directory of this repo with your merchant ID, your domain and your email address.\n\n1. Generate a *Payment Processing Certificate* request by running `make cert-processing.certSigningRequest` in the `certs/` directory.\n\n1. Upload the certificate request to the developer console. Select your merchant ID and click \"Create Certificate\" in the \"Payment Processing Certificate\" section\n\n1. Download the signed certificate to `certs/cert-processing.cer`, run `make cert-processing.crt` to convert it to the proper format\n\n1. Repeat steps 4-6 for the *Merchant Identity Certificate*, by running `make cert-merchant.certSigningRequest` and, with the certificate, `make cert-merchant.crt`\n\n1. Move the directory `certs/` to `example/certs/`\n\n1. Deploy the application under your domain. We have included a Dockerfile your your convenience; you should be able to run `docker build`, `docker push` and `docker run`.\n\n1. Go to the running application and try to pay with Apple Pay. If you don't see an Apple Pay button, you are probably visiting from an unsupported browser or device. You will not be charged.\n\n## Picking a Payment Service Provider (PSP) that supports Apple Pay\n\nSome PSPs, such as Braintree or Stripe, will accept Apple Pay payments on your behalf. That means that you don't have to use this package and just need to verify your domain with them. If you really want to, you can probably use this package and pass the tokens that decrypt yourself. Check with your processor for more info on how to know how to do that.\n\nOther payment services may not do the integration for you, but will let you pass Apple Pay-related values (such as the payment cryptogram). This package is made for you!\n\nIf you can't charge network tokens with your payment processor, unfortunately you will not be able to accept Apple Pay. Contact your provider for more details."

  "readme_contents": "## INDANCSClient\n#### Objective-C Apple Notification Center Service Implementation\n\n### Overview\n\nThis is an Objective-C client and server implementation of the [Apple Notification Center Service](https://developer.apple.com/library/IOS/documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/AppleNotificationCenterServiceSpecification/Introduction/Introduction.html) (ANCS) specification. This allows Bluetooth LE devices to connect to an iOS device running iOS 7 or later and receive all push/local notifications.\n\nThis project contains two main parts: \n\n1. **INDANCSServer** *(iOS 7+)* - a small component that runs on an iOS device to expose the ANCS service and some device information (name, model). \n2. **INDANCSClient** *(OS X 10.9+)* - a Mac framework that has a simple block based API for scanning and registering for notifications from iOS devices that are running the `INDANCSServer` code.\n\nI made this because it was a great way to learn the ins and outs of Core Bluetooth and because the idea of wirelessly receiving notifications from an iOS device is way cool.\n\n**WARNING: This is alpha quality code and hasn't been tested in production. Also, unit tests are yet to be implemented.**\n\n### Requirements\n\n* iPhone 4S/iPad 3 or better running iOS 7 or higher. Previous iPhone models (including iPhone 4) do not support Bluetooth 4.0.\n* A Mac with Bluetooth 4.0 support running OS X 10.9 or higher. Macs made after mid-2011 support Bluetooth 4.0 (starting with the mid-2011 MacBook Air). See [this page](http://www.everymac.com/systems/by_capability/macs-with-bluetooth-different-bluetooth-capabilities.html) for more info.\n\n### Getting Started\n\nThe easiest way to try out this project is to simply compile and run the `INDANCSiPhone` and `INDANCSMac` example projects on your iOS device and Mac, respectively. \n\nIf both devices have Bluetooth turned on, you should see a notification from the Mac app indicating that it has found your iOS device and from this point, any notification from the iOS device should appear in the Mac app's table view. Use the \"Post Test Notification\" button in the iOS app to try it instantly.\n\nThe sections below go into more detail on how to configure `INDANCSServer` and `INDANCSClient` in your own project.\n\n### INDANCSServer\n\nWhile the ANCS service exists on all iOS 7+ devices, it requires additional code to expose the service to outside peripherals. With `INDANCSServer`, this only takes a couple lines of code.\n\nLink against `CoreBluetooth.framework` and start advertising:\n\n```obj-c\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions\n{\n    self.server = [[INDANCSServer alloc] initWithUID:@\"INDANCSServer\"];\n\t[self.server startAdvertising];\n    return YES;\n}\n```\n\nThe UID parameter allows you to specify a restoration identifier for use with iOS 7's [Bluetooth State Preservation/Restoration](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/CoreBluetooth_concepts/CoreBluetoothBackgroundProcessingForIOSApps/PerformingTasksWhileYourAppIsInTheBackground.html) features. \n\nIf you want to advertise the ANCS service while the app is in the background, you also need to [add the `bluetooth-peripheral` background mode to your Info.plist file](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/iPhoneOSKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/plist/info/UIBackgroundModes).\n\n### INDANCSClient\n\n`INANCSClient` is distributed as a Mac framework.\n\n#### Scanning\n\n`INDANCSClient` provides a simple block-based API for scanning for iOS devices that are running `INDANCSServer`:\n\n```obj-c\n#import <INDANCSClient/INDANCSClientFramework.h>\n\nself.client = [[INDANCSClient alloc] init];\n[self.client scanForDevices:^(INDANCSClient *client, INDANCSDevice *device) {\n\tNSLog(@\"Found device: %@\", device.name);\n}];\n```\n\n#### Registering for Notifications\n\nAt the point where a device is found by `-scanForDevices:`, `INDANCSClient` has already connected to the device (necessary in order to retrieve device information). It will remain connected for a period of time that can be set using the `registrationTimeout` property. It is best to register for notifications within this window so that `INDANCSClient` doesn't need to reconnect to the device.\n\nNotification registration also uses a simple block-based API:\n\n```obj-c\n[client registerForNotificationsFromDevice:device withBlock:^(INDANCSClient *c, INDANCSNotification *n) {\n\tNSLog(@\"Notification: %@ - %@\", n.title, n.message);\n}];\n```\n\nThe `INDANCSNotification` object has all the information about the notification, including the device & application that it came from. Of particular importance is the `latestEventID` property, which tells you whether the notification was created, modified, or removed.\n\n#### Connection State\n\nThe `INDANCSClientDelegate` protocol documented in `INDANCSClient.h` has methods that inform the delegate about the connection state (e.g. when a device disconnects or fails to connect).\n\nSince Bluetooth connections can often be unreliable, `INDANCSClient` includes support for automatically attempting reconnection when a device disconnects through the `attemptsAutomaticReconnection` property, which is set to `YES` by default.\n\n#### Caching\n\n`INDANCSClient` implements an on-disk and in-memory cache of app attributes, as recommended by Apple's guidelines to avoid wasting energy by requesting app information over Bluetooth every time a notification is received.\n\nThe `INDANCSKeyValueStore` protocol describes the interface that you can use to implement your custom key-value store for use with `INDANCSClient`. Two existing implementations are provided with the framework:\n\n* **INDANCSInMemoryStore** - An in-memory key-value store backed by an `NSDictionary`.\n* **INDANCSObjectiveKVDBStore** - A persistent key-value store backed by [ObjectiveKVDB](https://github.com/indragiek/ObjectiveKVDB).\n\nCalling `-init` on `INDANCSClient` automatically initializes it using an instance of `INDANCSObjectiveKVDBStore` for persistent app metadata storage. If you want to use a different key-value store (or configure store file names, locations, etc.) you can use the `initWithMetadataStore:` initializer to pass in an object conforming to the `INDANCSKeyValueStore` protocol.\n\n### Contact\n\n* Indragie Karunaratne\n* [@indragie](http://twitter.com/indragie)\n* [http://indragie.com](http://indragie.com)\n\n### License\n\n`INDANCSClient` is licensed under the MIT License.\n"

You should be enrolled in [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/).\n2. Please have a look at [Apple documentation](\nhttps://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/get-started/) related to \"Sign in with Apple\" feature.\n3. You should create App ID and Service ID in your Apple Developer Account.\n4. You should generate private key for your Service ID in your Apple Developer Account.\n\n## Apple Signin Setup\nDeatiled confuguration instructions can be found at [blog post](https://medium.com/@artyomefremov/add-sign-in-with-apple-button-to-your-website-today-part-1-12ed1444623a?postPublishedType=initial) and [Apple docs](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/dev1c0e25352).\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save apple-signin-auth\n```\nOR\n```bash\nyarn add apple-signin-auth\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### 1. Get authorization URL\nStart \"Sign in with Apple\" flow by redirecting user to the authorization URL.\n```js\nimport appleSignin from 'apple-signin-auth';\n// OR const appleSignin = require('apple-signin-auth');\n// OR import { getAuthorizationUrl } from 'apple-signin-auth';\n\nconst options = {\n  clientID: 'com.company.app', // Apple Client ID\n  redirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/apple/callback',\n  // OPTIONAL\n  state: 'state', // optional, An unguessable random string. It is primarily used to protect against CSRF attacks.\n  responseMode: 'query' | 'fragment' | 'form_post', // Force set to form_post if scope includes 'email'\n  scope: 'email' // optional\n};\n\nconst authorizationUrl = appleSignin.getAuthorizationUrl(options);\n```\nAlternatively, you can use [Sign In with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplejs) browser javascript library.\n\n### 2. Get access token\n2.1. Retrieve \"code\" query param from URL string when user is redirected to your site after successful sign in with Apple. Example:\nhttp://localhost:3000/auth/apple/callback?code=somecode&state=123.\n\n2.2. Exchange retrieved \"code\" to user's access token.\n\nMore detail can be found in [Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplerestapi/generate_and_validate_tokens).\n\n```js\n\nconst clientSecret = appleSignin.getClientSecret({\n  clientID: 'com.company.app', // Apple Client ID\n  teamID: 'teamID', // Apple Developer Team ID.\n  privateKey: 'PRIVATE_KEY_STRING', // private key associated with your client ID. -- Or provide a `privateKeyPath` property instead.\n  keyIdentifier: 'XXX', // identifier of the private key.\n  // OPTIONAL\n  expAfter: 15777000, // Unix time in seconds after which to expire the clientSecret JWT. Default is now+5 minutes.\n});\n\nconst options = {\n  clientID: 'com.company.app', // Apple Client ID\n  redirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/apple/callback', // use the same value which you passed to authorisation URL.\n  clientSecret: clientSecret\n};\n\ntry {\n  const tokenResponse = await appleSignin.getAuthorizationToken(code, options);\n} catch (err) {\n  console.error(err);\n}\n```\n\nResult of ```getAuthorizationToken``` command is a JSON object representing Apple's [TokenResponse](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplerestapi/tokenresponse):\n```js\n{\n    access_token: 'ACCESS_TOKEN', // A token used to access allowed data.\n    token_type: 'Bearer', // It will always be Bearer.\n    expires_in: 300, // The amount of time, in seconds, before the access token expires.\n    refresh_token: 'REFRESH_TOKEN', // used to regenerate new access tokens. Store this token securely on your server.\n    id_token: 'ID_TOKEN' // A JSON Web Token that contains the user\u2019s identity information.\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Verify token signature and get unique user's identifier\n```js\ntry {\n  const { sub: userAppleId } = await appleSignin.verifyIdToken(tokenResponse.id_token, {\n    // Optional Options for further verification - Full list can be found here https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#jwtverifytoken-secretorpublickey-options-callback\n    audience: 'com.company.app', // client id - can also be an array\n    nonce: 'NONCE', // nonce // Check this note if coming from React Native AS RN automatically SHA256-hashes the nonce https://github.com/invertase/react-native-apple-authentication#nonce\n    // If you want to handle expiration on your own, or if you want the expired tokens decoded\n    ignoreExpiration: true, // default is false\n  });\n} catch (err) {\n  // Token is not verified\n  console.error(err);\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Refresh access token after expiration\n```js\n\nconst clientSecret = appleSignin.getClientSecret({\n  clientID: 'com.company.app', // Apple Client ID\n  teamID: 'teamID', // Apple Developer Team ID.\n  privateKey: 'PRIVATE_KEY_STRING', // private key associated with your client ID. -- Or provide a `privateKeyPath` property instead.\n  keyIdentifier: 'XXXXXXXXXX', // identifier of the private key. - can be found here https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list\n  // OPTIONAL\n  expAfter: 15777000, // Duration after which to expire JWT\n});\n\nconst options = {\n  clientID: 'com.company.app', // Apple Client ID\n  clientSecret\n};\n\ntry {\n  const {\n    access_token\n  } = appleSignin.refreshAuthorizationToken(refreshToken, options);\n} catch (err) {\n  console.error(err);\n}\n```\n\n### 5. a, Revoke tokens with refresh_token\n```js\n\nconst clientSecret = appleSignin.getClientSecret({\n  clientID: 'com.company.app', // Apple Client ID\n  teamID: 'teamID', // Apple Developer Team ID.\n  privateKey: 'PRIVATE_KEY_STRING', // private key associated with your client ID. -- Or provide a `privateKeyPath` property instead.\n  keyIdentifier: 'XXXXXXXXXX', // identifier of the private key. - can be found here https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list\n  // OPTIONAL\n  expAfter: 15777000, // Duration after which to expire JWT\n});\n\nconst options = {\n  clientID: 'com.company.app', // Apple Client ID\n  clientSecret,\n  tokenTypeHint: 'refresh_token'\n};\n\ntry {\n  await appleSignin.revokeAuthorizationToken(refreshToken, options);\n} catch (err) {\n  console.error(err);\n}\n```\n\n### 5. b, Revoke tokens with access_token\n```js\n\nconst clientSecret = appleSignin.getClientSecret({\n  clientID: 'com.company.app', // Apple Client ID\n  teamID: 'teamID', // Apple Developer Team ID.\n  privateKey: 'PRIVATE_KEY_STRING', // private key associated with your client ID. -- Or provide a `privateKeyPath` property instead.\n  keyIdentifier: 'XXXXXXXXXX', // identifier of the private key. - can be found here https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list\n  // OPTIONAL\n  expAfter: 15777000, // Duration after which to expire JWT\n});\n\nconst options = {\n  clientID: 'com.company.app', // Apple Client ID\n  clientSecret,\n  tokenTypeHint: 'access_token'\n};\n\ntry {\n  await appleSignin.revokeAuthorizationToken(accessToken, options);\n} catch (err) {\n  console.error(err);\n}\n```\n\n### Optional: Server-to-Server Notifications\n\nApple provides realtime server-to-server notifications of several user lifecycle\nevents:\n\n- `email-disabled`: The user hides their email behind Apple's private email\n  relay, and has opted to stop having emails forwarded by the private relay\n  service.\n- `email-enabled`: The user hides their email behind Apple's private email\n  relay, and has opted to resume having emails forwarded by the private relay\n  service.\n- `consent-revoked`: The user has decided to stop using Apple ID with your\n  application, e.g. by disconnecting the application from Settings. This should\n  be treated as a sign-out out by the user.\n- `account-delete`: The user has asked Apple to permanently delete their Apple\n  ID. The user identifier is no longer valid.\n\nNotifications are sent for each app group.\n\nThe notification is sent as a `POST` request with a JSON body. The request body\ncontains a JWT, with the event description on the JWT payload.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"payload\": \"<server-to-server notification JWT>\"\n}\n```\n\nTo receive these notifications, you must do the following steps.\n\n#### 1. Host the webhook\n\n```js\napp.get(\"/apple-signin-webhook\", async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const { events } = await appleSignin.verifyWebhookToken(\n      req.body.payload,\n      {\n        // Optional Options for further verification - Full list can be found here https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#jwtverifytoken-secretorpublickey-options-callback\n        audience: 'com.company.app', // client id - can also be an array\n      },\n    );\n    const {\n      sub: userAppleId,\n      type,\n      email // Only provided for email events\n    } = events;\n\n    switch (type) {\n      case 'email-disabled':\n        // Email will no longer be forwarded to the user via the private relay service\n        break;\n      case 'email-enabled':\n        // Email will be forwarded to the user again\n        break;\n      case 'consent-revoked':\n        // The user has decided to stop using Apple ID with this application - log them out\n        break;\n      case 'account-delete':\n        // The user has deleted their Apple ID\n        break;\n    }\n\n    res.sendStatus(200);\n} catch (e) {\n  // Event token is not verified\n  console.error(err)\n  res.sendStatus(500);\n});\n```\n\nNote:\n\n- TLS 1.2 is required to receive notifications at the specified endpoint.\n\n#### 2. Configure the webhook URL in the Apple Developer console\n\n2.1. Sign in to Apple Developer, go to \"Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles\",\nand select the Primary App ID for your application.\n\n2.2 Enable the \"Sign in with Apple\" capability (if not already enabled) and\nclick \"Configure\" (or \"Edit\").\n\n2.3 Under \"Server to Server Notification Endpoint\", enter the fully-qualified\nURL for your webhook, e.g. `https://example.com/api/apple-signin-webhook`,\nand save the changes.\n\nNotes:\n\n- A server-to-server webhook can only be configured for a Primary App ID.\n- The Apple docs for this step are located [here](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/?lang=en#/dev217f824b6).\n\n### Extra API functions\n- _setFetch: `(fetchFn: function) => void` - Sets the fetch function, defaults to node-fetch. eg: appleSigninAuth._setFetch(fetchWithProxy);\n\n## Extras\n- Handles apple public keys switching solving this issue https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/129047\n- Caches Apple's public keys and only refetches when needed\n- ES6 (Can be imported using `import appleSigning from 'apple-signin-auth/src'`)\n- Flow and TypeScript Types\n\n## Related Projects\n- [Apple Signin for web (React/Vue)](https://github.com/A-Tokyo/react-apple-signin)\n- [Apple Signin for React Native](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-apple-authentication)\n\n## Helpful resources\n- [React Native: Sign in with Apple by Ross Bulat](https://medium.com/@rossbulat/react-native-sign-in-with-apple-75733d3fbc3)\n- [Web: Signin with Apple](https://dev.to/onygami/how-to-add-signin-with-apple-on-your-website-43m9)\n  - Note that the frontend implementation can be replaced with [Apple Signin for web (React/Vue)](https://github.com/A-Tokyo/react-apple-signin).\n\n\n## Contributing\nPull requests are highly appreciated!

Use it at your own risk!\n\nStart by generating a new kernel cache, without the `AppleSerialShim` extension:\n\n```\nsudo kmutil create -n boot -a arm64e -B /Library/KernelCollections/kc.noshim.macho -V release  -k /System/Library/Kernels/kernel.release.<soc> -r /System/Library/Extensions -r /System/Library/DriverExtensions -x $(kmutil inspect -V release --no-header | awk '!/AppleSerialShim/ { print \" -b \"$1; }')\n```\n\nReplace `<soc>` with `t8101` on M1 Macs and `t6000` on M1 Pro/Max Macs. If you\u2019re unsure, `uname -v` and look at the end of the version string (`RELEASE_ARM64_<soc>`).\n\nThen, enter 1TR:\n\n1. Power off your Mac\n2. Press and hold the Power button until the boot menu appears\n3. Select \u201cOptions\u201d, then (if necessary) select your macOS volume and enter your administrative password.\n\nSelect Utilities>Startup security and switch the macOS installation to reduced security. Exit Startup security.\n\nSelect Utilities>Terminal and install your custom kernel:\n\n```\nkmutil configure-boot -c /Volume/<volume>/Library/KernelCollections/kc.noshim.macho -C -v /Volume/<volume>\n```\n\nReplace `<volume>` with the name of your boot volume.\n\nYou can now reboot: macOS should start as normal, and the serial device `/dev/cu.debug-console` should be available.\n\nTo revert back to the default kernel, enter 1TR again, access Utilities>Startup security and switch to full or reduced security.\n\n## Building\n\nInstall the XCode commandline tools and type `make`.\n\n## Usage\n\nConnect the two devices via their DFU ports. That's:\n - the rear port on MacBook Air and 13\" MacBook Pro\n - the port next to the MagSafe connector on the 14\" and 16\" MacBook Pro\n - the port nearest to the power plug on Mac Mini\n\nYou need to use a *USB 3.0 compatible* (SuperSpeed) Type C cable. USB 2.0-only cables, including most cables meant for charging, will not work, as they do not have the required pins. Thunderbolt cables work too.\n\nRun it as root (`sudo ./macvdmtool`).\n\n```\nUsage: ./macvdmtool <command>\nCommands:\n  serial - enter serial mode on both ends\n  reboot - reboot the target\n  reboot serial - reboot the target and enter serial mode\n  dfu - put the target into DFU mode\n  nop - do nothing\n```\n\nUse `/dev/cu.debug_console` on the local machine as your serial device. To use it with m1n1, `export M1N1DEVICE=/dev/cu.debug-console`.\n\nFor typical development, the command you want to use is `macvdmtool reboot serial`. This will reboot the target, and immediately put it back into serial mode, with the right timing to make it work.\n"

You will also have to add the key `Privacy - Location When In Use Usage Description` with the value of your usage description.\n\n# Android\n\nThere is no Android implementation, but there is a package combining apple_maps_flutter and the google_maps_flutter plugin to have the typical map implementations for Android/iOS called platform_maps_flutter.\n\n## Sample Usage\n\n```dart\nclass AppleMapsExample extends StatelessWidget {\n  AppleMapController mapController;\n\n  void _onMapCreated(AppleMapController controller) {\n    mapController = controller;\n  }\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Column(\n      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,\n      crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.stretch,\n      children: <Widget>[\n        Expanded(\n          child: Container(\n            child: AppleMap(\n              onMapCreated: _onMapCreated,\n              initialCameraPosition: const CameraPosition(\n                target: LatLng(0.0, 0.0),\n              ),\n            ),\n          ),\n        ),\n        Row(\n          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,\n          children: <Widget>[\n            Column(\n              children: <Widget>[\n                FlatButton(\n                  onPressed: () {\n                    mapController.moveCamera(\n                      CameraUpdate.newCameraPosition(\n                        const CameraPosition(\n                          heading: 270.0,\n                          target: LatLng(51.5160895, -0.1294527),\n                          pitch: 30.0,\n                          zoom: 17,\n                        ),\n                      ),\n                    );\n                  },\n                  child: const Text('newCameraPosition'),\n                ),\n                FlatButton(\n                  onPressed: () {\n                    mapController.moveCamera(\n                      CameraUpdate.newLatLngZoom(\n                        const LatLng(37.4231613, -122.087159),\n                        11.0,\n                      ),\n                    );\n                  },\n                  child: const Text('newLatLngZoom'),\n                ),\n              ],\n            ),\n            Column(\n              children: <Widget>[\n                FlatButton(\n                  onPressed: () {\n                    mapController.moveCamera(\n                      CameraUpdate.zoomIn(),\n                    );\n                  },\n                  child: const Text('zoomIn'),\n                ),\n                FlatButton(\n                  onPressed: () {\n                    mapController.moveCamera(\n                      CameraUpdate.zoomOut(),\n                    );\n                  },\n                  child: const Text('zoomOut'),\n                ),\n                FlatButton(\n                  onPressed: () {\n                    mapController.moveCamera(\n                      CameraUpdate.zoomTo(16.0),\n                    );\n                  },\n                  child: const Text('zoomTo'),\n                ),\n              ],\n            ),\n          ],\n        )\n      ],\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSuggestions and PR's to make this plugin better are always welcome.\n"

DNSCloak is an excellent app capable of using these files, but it's a bit of a pain to get the blocklists onto your device. **Services such as updates, App Store, and Apple Pay will probably be blocked by this list.** You can remove entries manually, but this is tedious, so I recommend just temporarily disabling the blocklist when necessary.\n\nHere's a vague [overview of what each domain is for](https://github.com/cedws/apple-telemetry/wiki/Domains).\n\n## Why?\n\nUsers should have more control over the telemetry sent by their smartphones. Not only that, but I've seen a large improvement to my device's battery life while using these blocklists.\n\n## Usage (iOS)\n\n- Download DNSCloak, or another app capable of using DNS blocklists\n- Navigate to [releases](https://github.com/cedws/apple-telemetry/releases)\n- Copy the desired blocklist to your clipboard (`cloaking-rules` is recommended)\n- Download Textor, or another app capable of saving text to Files\n- In Textor, create a new file and paste the blocklist\n- Remove domains for services you wish to use (such as Apple Pay)\n- Navigate to the DNSCloak settings and select the saved blocklist\n\n## Usage (macOS)\n\n- Add desired hosts to block to `/etc/hosts`\n\n## Notes\n\n* This is not an exhaustive list. There are hundreds of domains contacted on a regular basis by Apple devices, with no consistent naming scheme or obvious purpose. If you want to block all domains, you should use a whitelist.\n\n* Some domains may not be related to Apple. I've had to filter out the domains from my own blacklist log manually. However, some domains such as `weather.com` are contacted by built-in applications (Weather). Entries like these belong in this repository.\n\n## Contribution\n\nIf you come across any other domains, please submit a PR! Add the entries to the `blacklist` file then run `make` (you'll also need Python 3 - use the Poetry package manager). It can take a few minutes because it has to make a lot of DNS queries.\n\n## Similar Projects\n\n- https://gitlab.com/intr0/AppleBlock"

  "readme_contents": "<!--*- mode:markdown -*-->\nM3U8 [![](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go#video)\n====\n\nThis is the most complete opensource library for parsing and generating of M3U8 playlists\nused in HTTP Live Streaming (Apple HLS) for internet video translations.\n\nM3U8 is simple text format and parsing library for it must be simple too. It does not offer\nways to play HLS or handle playlists over HTTP. So library features are:\n\n* Support HLS specs up to version 5 of the protocol.\n* Parsing and generation of master-playlists and media-playlists.\n* Autodetect input streams as master or media playlists.\n* Offer structures for keeping playlists metadata.\n* Encryption keys support for use with DRM systems like [Verimatrix](http://verimatrix.com) etc.\n* Support for non standard [Google Widevine](http://www.widevine.com) tags.\n\nThe library covered by BSD 3-clause license. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the full text.\nVersions 0.8 and below was covered by GPL v3. License was changed from the version 0.9 and upper.\n\nSee the list of the library authors at [AUTHORS](AUTHORS) file.\n\nInstall\n-------\n\n\tgo get github.com/grafov/m3u8\n\nor get releases from https://github.com/grafov/m3u8/releases\n\nDocumentation [![Go Walker](http://gowalker.org/api/v1/badge)](http://gowalker.org/github.com/grafov/m3u8) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/grafov/m3u8?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/grafov/m3u8)\n-------------\n\nPackage online documentation (examples included) available at:\n\n* http://gowalker.org/github.com/grafov/m3u8\n* http://godoc.org/github.com/grafov/m3u8\n\nSupported by the HLS protocol tags and their library support explained in [M3U8 cheatsheet](M3U8.md).\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nParse playlist:\n\n```go\n\tf, err := os.Open(\"playlist.m3u8\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tpanic(err)\n\t}\n\tp, listType, err := m3u8.DecodeFrom(bufio.NewReader(f), true)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tpanic(err)\n\t}\n\tswitch listType {\n\tcase m3u8.MEDIA:\n\t\tmediapl := p.(*m3u8.MediaPlaylist)\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"%+v\\n\", mediapl)\n\tcase m3u8.MASTER:\n\t\tmasterpl := p.(*m3u8.MasterPlaylist)\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"%+v\\n\", masterpl)\n\t}\n```\n\nThen you get filled with parsed data structures. For master playlists you get ``Master`` struct with slice consists of pointers to ``Variant`` structures (which represent playlists to each bitrate).\nFor media playlist parser returns ``MediaPlaylist`` structure with slice of ``Segments``. Each segment is of ``MediaSegment`` type.\nSee ``structure.go`` or full documentation (link below).\n\nYou may use API methods to fill structures or create them manually to generate playlists. Example of media playlist generation:\n\n```go\n\tp, e := m3u8.NewMediaPlaylist(3, 10) // with window of size 3 and capacity 10\n\tif e != nil {\n\t\tpanic(fmt.Sprintf(\"Creating of media playlist failed: %s\", e))\n\t}\n\tfor i := 0; i < 5; i++ {\n\t\te = p.Append(fmt.Sprintf(\"test%d.ts\", i), 6.0, \"\")\n\t\tif e != nil {\n\t\t\tpanic(fmt.Sprintf(\"Add segment #%d to a media playlist failed: %s\", i, e))\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tfmt.Println(p.Encode().String())\n```\n\nCustom Tags\n-----------\n\nM3U8 supports parsing and writing of custom tags. You must implement both the `CustomTag` and `CustomDecoder` interface for each custom tag that may be encountered in the playlist. Look at the template files in `example/template/` for examples on parsing custom playlist and segment tags.\n\nLibrary structure\n-----------------\n\nLibrary has compact code and bundled in three files:\n\n* `structure.go` \u2014 declares all structures related to playlists and their properties\n* `reader.go` \u2014 playlist parser methods\n* `writer.go` \u2014 playlist generator methods\n\nEach file has own test suite placed in `*_test.go` accordingly.\n\nRelated links\n-------------\n\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming\n* http://gonze.com/playlists/playlist-format-survey.html\n\nLibrary usage\n-------------\n\nThis library was successfully used in streaming software developed for company where I worked several\nyears ago. It was tested then in generating of VOD and Live streams and parsing of Widevine Live streams.\nAlso the library used in opensource software so you may look at these apps for usage examples:\n\n* [HLS downloader](https://github.com/kz26/gohls)\n* [Another HLS downloader](https://github.com/Makombo/hlsdownloader)\n* [HLS utils](https://github.com/archsh/hls-utils)\n* [M3U8 reader](https://github.com/jeongmin/m3u8-reader)\n\nProject status [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/grafov/m3u8)](https://goreportcard.com/report/grafov/m3u8)\n--------------\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/grafov/m3u8.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/grafov/m3u8) [![Build Status](https://cloud.drone.io/api/badges/grafov/m3u8/status.svg)](https://cloud.drone.io/grafov/m3u8) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/grafov/m3u8/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/grafov/m3u8?branch=master)\n\n[![DeepSource](https://static.deepsource.io/deepsource-badge-light.svg)](https://deepsource.io/gh/grafov/m3u8/?ref=repository-badge)\n\nCode coverage: https://gocover.io/github.com/grafov/m3u8\n\nProject maintainers:\n\n* Lei Gao @leikao\n* Bradley Falzon @bradleyfalzon\n* Alexander Grafov @grafov\n\nRoadmap\n-------\n\nTo version 1.0:\n\n* Support all M3U8 tags up to latest version of specs.\n* Code coverage by unit tests up to 90%\n\nFYI M3U8 parsing/generation in other languages\n------------------------------------------\n\n* https://github.com/globocom/m3u8 in Python\n* https://github.com/zencoder/m3uzi in Ruby\n* https://github.com/Jeanvf/M3U8Paser in Objective C\n* https://github.com/tedconf/node-m3u8 in Javascript\n* http://sourceforge.net/projects/m3u8parser/ in Java\n* https://github.com/karlll/erlm3u8 in Erlang\n"

  "repo": "beezwax/WP-Publish-to-Apple-News",
  "language": "PHP",
  "readme_contents": "#Publish to Apple News\n\n##Installation\n\nInstalling the Publish to Apple News plugin is similar to the process of\ninstalling other WordPress plugins. Simply perform these steps:\n\n1. Download the Publish to Apple News plugin.\n2. Upload the entire \u201capple-news\u201d folder to the \u201c./wp-content/plugins\u201d directory\n   on your web server.\n3. Activate the Publish to Apple News plugin using the \u201cPlugins\u201d menu in\n   WordPress.\n\nOnce activated, the \"Apple News\" menu should appear in your WordPress Admin\npanel.\n\n###Troubleshooting: Resolving Potential Permissions Issues\n\nIn most cases, the Publish to Apple News plugin should function immediately once\ninstalled. However, in some cases the default permissions WordPress has set for\nthe plugin directory may be too restrictive to allow plugins to function\nproperly. If you encounter errors, you may need to modify the permissions of\nboth the \u201c./apple-export/workspace\u201d and the  \u201c./apple-export/workspace/tmp\u201d\ndirectories. In most cases, setting permissions for these two directories to\n\u201c775\u201d will enable plugins to function properly. For additional information and\ndetailed instructions for setting WordPress directory permissions, please see\n[this WordPress technical post](http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions).\n\n##Configuration\n\nOnce the Publish to Apple News plugin has been installed and activated, the next\nstep is configuration. To begin, choose *Settings > Apple News* from the\nWordPress Admin panel.\n\n###Publishing your WordPress Site to Apple News\n\nThis plugin is not responsible for setting up or managing your News Publisher\nchannel with Apple, nor does using this plugin guarantee that Apple News will\naccept your content. Some information and links to documentation are provided\nhere to point you in the right direction for this process. Please see the Apple\nDeveloper and Apple News Publisher documentation and terms on Apple\u2019s website\nfor complete information.\n\nTo enable content from your WordPress blog to be published to your Apple News\nchannel, you must obtain and enter your Apple News API credentials from Apple to\nenable your WordPress content to be published to Apple News.\n\nTo obtain these credentials, click the \u201cApple News documentation\u201d link at the\ntop of the \u201cAPI Settings\u201d subsection of *Settings > Apple News*. This link will\ndirect you to instructions for obtaining your credentials. Once you receive them\nfrom Apple, enter your private API Key, Secret, and Channel settings into the\n\u201cApple News API\u201d fields. Once entered, you can begin publishing WordPress site\ncontent to Apple News.\n\n###General (Site-wide) Settings\n\nOnce your WordPress site has been linked to your Apple News channel, your next\nstep is to configure site-wide general settings that determine how your content\nwill be published to Apple News. You may want to review these site-wide settings\non occasion.\n\n####Choosing How Content is Published to Apple News\n\nThe most important setting is the \u201cAutomatically Publish to Apple News\u201d setting,\nlocated at the bottom of the \u201cApple News API\u201d subsection of *Settings > Apple\nNews*.\n\nBy default, this option is set to **Yes**, so that whenever you publish or\nupdate an article on your own WordPress site, the article will also be\nautomatically pushed to your Apple News channel, without any additional action\nor customization on your part. In most cases, this setting is recommended.\n\nIf you would instead prefer more granular control over which content is posted\nto your Apple News channel, set \u201cAutomatically Publish\u2026\u201d to **No**. With this\nsetting, new content posted to your site will *not* be automatically pushed to\nyour Apple News channel. In this case, you will need to manually push any posts\nyou create, or later modify, to Apple News (this process is described in\n\u201cPer-Post Settings\u201d below).\n\n####Set Default Formatting\n\nThe \u201cFormatting\u201d subsection of *Settings > Apple News* provides options that\ndetermine the general appearance for how posts in Apple News should appear.\nThese settings are relatively detailed, giving you a higher level of control\nover how your content should appear. Note that if you do not apply specific\npreferences, the default settings have been designed so that your content will\nhave a consistent, professional appearance.\n\n####Advanced Settings\n\nAdvanced settings allow you to set custom content height settings. In most\ncases, the default settings will provide the best results. However, you can also\nenter custom values if desired (values are typographical point sizes). To return\nto the default values, simply clear any values entered into these fields.\n\n##Usage\n\nOnce the above steps are completed, you\u2019re ready to publish content to Apple\nNews. If you\u2019ve chosen to automatically publish your blog content to Apple News,\nall posts created and updated from this time forward will automatically be\npushed to your Apple News channel. If you\u2019ve disabled Automatic Publishing to\nApple News, the following section describes the tools you\u2019ll use to manually\npublish selected posts from your WordPress site to Apple News.\n\nIn addition, no matter which Automatic Publishing option you\u2019ve selected, this\nsection describes how you can override general settings for any specific post as\ndesired.\n\n###The \u201cApple News\u201d Admin Panel Menu\n\nThe \u201cApple News\u201d menu (not to be confused with the site-wide *Settings > Apple\nNews* described in the previous section) provides important tools and settings\nfor specific posts.\n\n####Controlling Individual Posts\n\nThe top section of the \u201cApple News\u201d pane provides a dashboard-like view that\ndisplays each post you\u2019ve published on your WordPress blog, as well as whether\neach post has been published to your Apple News channel, and if so, the date of\nthe latest update. In addition, individual and bulk controls give you granular\ncontrol over each post.\n\nAs described above, if you\u2019ve chosen to automatically publish content to Apple\nNews, each new post that you publish (or later update) on your own WordPress\nsite will also be automatically pushed to your Apple News channel. In this case,\nyour primary use of these settings will likely be to override any posts you\nchoose not to publish to Apple News.\n\nOn the other hand, if you\u2019ve chosen *not* to automatically publish your content\nto Apple News, you will likely use these settings much more frequently. These\nsettings will be the tool you\u2019ll use each time you wish to initially publish \u2014\nor later update \u2014 WordPress posts to Apple News.\n\n####Individual Controls\n\nTo publish a single post to your Apple News channel (or perform other actions),\nlocate the desired post in the list of your locally published content, and hover\nyour mouse immediately below the post\u2019s title. This will display a contextual\nmenu, presenting the following choices: \u201cOptions\u201d, \u201cDownload\u201d, and \u201cPublish\u201d. In\naddition, for posts already published to Apple News, two more choices will be\ndisplayed: \u201cDelete from Apple News\u201d and \u201cCopy News URL\u201c.\n\nChoosing \u201cPublish\u201d or \u201cDelete from Apple News\u201d will either push the current\nversion of the selected post to Apple News, or permanently remove the post from\nApple News. You can override either choice at any future time (e.g., a post\ndeleted from Apple News can later be published once again if desired). Note that\nonce a post has been deleted from Apple News, no further updates will\nautomatically be published to Apple News, regardless of whether you\u2019ve enabled\n\u201cAutomatically Publish to Apple News\u201d in your general settings.\n\nThe \u201cDownload\u201d option will generate a JSON\ndocument describing the selected post to your\nbrowser\u2019s default Downloads location.\n\nFinally, the \u201cOptions\u201d menu allows you to create a Pull Quote for the selected\npost. In addition to entering a pull quote, you can choose to place it at the\ntop, middle, or bottom of the selected post.\n\n####Bulk Publishing Controls\n\nBulk actions can be particularly helpful for pushing older content to your Apple\nNews channel. This is because Automatic Publishing only takes effect on content\ncreated or modified after the Publish to Apple News plugin has been installed.\nTherefore, to push a number of pre-existing posts to Apple News, Bulk Publishing\ncan save significant time and redundant steps.\n\n*Warning: Using Bulk Publishing for a large number of pre-existing posts at one\ntime may require significant processing time and server resources. It is\nrecommended that you test this feature with smaller batches of pre-existing\nposts first.*\n\nYou can choose to publish several posts to your Apple News channel at once,\nusing the *Bulk Actions* control located at the top left of this section. Simply\ncheck any number of desired posts, then select \u201cpublish\u201d from the Bulk Actions\nmenu. This will open a page displaying the posts you\u2019ve selected, and the status\nof each post as it is pushed to Apple News. Note that while bulk publishing\nactions are in progress, you should not close your browser window or navigate\naway from this page. Doing so will halt the bulk action in progress.\n\n\n###Tips\n\nIn general, little effort should be required to prepare your content itself for\npublishing to Apple News once you\u2019ve configured this plugin to your desired\nsettings. Even so, these simple tips will help your content look its best:\n\n####Controlling Image Placement\n\nBy default, images inserted in your content will be placed inline, and will\nfollow WordPress placement rules. You may find your images will be presented\nbetter within Apple News if you take the time to set the appearance of each\nimage. To do this, in the WordPress text editor, click on an image, which will\ndisplay a contextual alignment menu. This will provide you with a series of\nsimple granular controls, allowing you to determine more precisely where each\nimage will be displayed when your post appears in Apple News.\n\nNote that images smaller than the body width (~1024px) will always be aligned.\nIf you want to display an image without alignment, make sure it\u2019s big enough.\n\n####Banners\n\nYou may also select an image to appear as a banner at the top of your post. To\ndo this, choose a [featured image](https://en.support.wordpress.com/featured-images/)\nby clicking on the \u201cSet Featured Image\u201d link when creating or updating a post.\nThe image will displayed full width at the top of the selected post.\n\n####Image Galleries\n\nYou can add image galleries the same way you do in WordPress, by using the \u201cAdd\nMedia\u201d button in the WordPress editor. Once there, navigate to \u201cCreate Gallery\u201d\nand choose any images you want. Once done, choose to use \u201cFull Size\u201d images\ninstead of thumbnails. By default, galleries will be shown as a horizontal\nslide; if desired, you can change this to \u201cMosaic\u201d style in the plugin settings.\n\n####Advertisement\n\nWhile this plugin is not responsible for managing advertising options for your\nApple News channel, it does provide simple settings to help you prepare your\ncontent for this. Please see the Apple News Publisher and iAds documentation and\nterms on Apple\u2019s website for more information about advertising options on Apple\nNews.\n\nBy default, your exported posts should be ready to include advertising content\nsomewhere in the middle of your content. If you don\u2019t want your WordPress\ncontent to be prepared in this way, simply set the \u201cAdvertisement\u201d option in the\nplugin settings to **No**.\n\n# For developers\nIf you are a developer, feel free to keep reading if you want to contribute. Publish to Apple News WordPress plugin works only on the admin-side so no `public/` folder.\n\n## Coding standards\nPHP code must follow WordPress [Coding\nStandards](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards).\n\nUsing [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org) is recommended so files always\nuse the same formatting.\n\n## Requirements\nIn order to work with the plugin, you'll need a webserver such as Apache with\nPHP 5.3+ and MySQL 5+.\n\nIt's recommended to create a symbolic link for better code organization.\n\n1. `git clone ssh://... apple-export`\n2. `cd apple-export`\n3. `ln -s /home/my-user/my-projects/wppl /var/www/my-wp-installation/wp-content/plugins/apple-export`\n\nMake sure `/home/my-user` has execute permissions or WordPress might not show it\nas a plugin. You can do so by doing `chmod o+x /home/my-user`.\n\n### PHP Configuration\nMake sure PHP's `memory_limit` setting is big enough, or set to -1, as the\nplugin might work with big images. Also make sure PHP's upload limit is big enough.\n\n## Running tests\nYou'll need PHPUnit v4.5+ to run tests. Initially you'll need to set up the\ntest environment, you can do so by running\n\n    bin/install-wp-tests.sh <db-name> <db-user> <db-pass> [db-host] [wp-version]\n\nFor example\n\n    bin/install-wp-tests.sh wp_test root '' localhost latest\n\nThat script will download latest wordpress as well as latest wordpress' tests so\n`/tests/bootstrap.php` can load them.\n\nYou'll also need to set up your API credentials using your system's\nenvironmental variables. For UNIX systems (OS X, Linux, etc) you can simply edit\nthe `~/.profile` file, adding your variables as follows:\n\n    export WP_PLUGIN_KEY=my-api-key\n    export WP_PLUGIN_SECRET=my-api-secret\n    export WP_PLUGIN_CHANNEL=my-api-channel\n\nOnce updated, reload it using `source ~/.profile`. Test it out by doing `echo\n$WP_PLUGIN_KEY`, it should display your key in the terminal.\n\nNow you can simply use the `phpunit` command to run the tests.\n"

Tweak the build phase run script to run Tailor **only** when analyzing the project (\u21e7\u2318B)\n```bash\nif [ \"${CONFIGURATION}\" = \"Analyze\" ]; then\n    if hash tailor 2>/dev/null; then\n        tailor\n    else\n        echo \"warning: Please install Tailor from https://tailor.sh\"\n    fi\nfi\n```\n\n## Colorized Output\n\nTailor uses the following color schemes to format CLI output:\n\n* **Dark theme** (enabled by default)\n  ![Dark theme](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1791760/9807444/fde82de6-5870-11e5-9e20-05a9d736e136.png)\n\n* **Light theme** (enabled via `--invert-color` option)\n  ![Light theme](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1791760/9807312/129ce45e-586f-11e5-8e26-fe818af0ec09.png)\n\n* **No color theme** (enabled via `--no-color` option)\n  ![No color](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1791760/9807318/261811d4-586f-11e5-9010-0e627431bbb9.png)\n\n## Warnings, Errors, and Failing the Build\n\n`--max-severity` can be used to control the maximum severity of violation messages. It can be set to `error` or `warning` (by default, it is set to `warning`). Setting it to `error` allows you to distinguish between lower and higher priority messages. It also fails the build in Xcode, if any errors are reported (similar to how a compiler error fails the build in Xcode). With `max-severity` set to `warning`, all violation messages are warnings and the Xcode build will never fail.\n\nThis setting also affects Tailor's exit code on the command-line, a failing build will `exit 1` whereas having warnings only will `exit 0`, allowing Tailor to be easily integrated into pre-commit hooks.\n\n## Disable Violations within Source Code\n\nViolations on a specific line may be disabled with a **trailing** single-line comment.\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation; // tailor:disable\n```\n\nAdditionally, violations in a given block of code can be disabled by **enclosing the block** within `tailor:off` and `tailor:on` comments.\n\n```swift\n// tailor:off\nimport Foundation;\nimport UIKit;\nimport CoreData;\n// tailor:on\n\nclass Demo() {\n  // Define public members here\n}\n```\n\n### Note\n\n* `// tailor:off` and `// tailor:on` comments must be paired\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe behavior of Tailor can be customized via the `.tailor.yml` configuration file. It enables you to\n\n* include/exclude certain files and directories from analysis\n* enable and disable specific analysis rules\n* specify output format\n* specify CLI output color scheme\n\nYou can tell Tailor which configuration file to use by specifying its file path via the `--config` CLI option. By default, Tailor will look for the configuration file in the directory where you will run Tailor from.\n\nThe file follows the [YAML 1.1](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.1/) format.\n\n### Including/Excluding files\n\nTailor checks all files found by a recursive search starting from the directories given as command line arguments. However, it only analyzes Swift files that end in `.swift`. If you would like Tailor to analyze specific files and directories, you will have to add entries for them under `include`. Files and directories can also be ignored through `exclude`.\n\nHere is an example that might be used for an iOS project:\n\n```yaml\ninclude:\n    - Source            # Inspect all Swift files under \"Source/\"\nexclude:\n    - '**Tests.swift'   # Ignore Swift files that end in \"Tests\"\n    - Source/Carthage   # Ignore Swift files under \"Source/Carthage/\"\n    - Source/Pods       # Ignore Swift files under \"Source/Pods/\"\n```\n\n#### Notes\n\n* Files and directories are specified relative to where `tailor` is run from\n* Paths to directories or Swift files provided explicitly via CLI will cause the `include`/`exclude` rules specified in `.tailor.yml` to be ignored\n* *Exclude* is given higher precedence than *Include*\n* Tailor recognizes the [Java Glob](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/fileOps.html#glob) syntax\n\n### Enabling/Disabling rules\n\nTailor allows you to individually disable (blacklist) or enable (whitelist) rules via the `except` and `only` labels.\n\nHere is an example showcasing how to enable certain rules:\n\n```yaml\n# Tailor will solely check for violations to the following rules\nonly:\n    - upper-camel-case\n    - trailing-closure\n    - forced-type-cast\n    - redundant-parentheses\n```\n\nHere is an example showcasing how to disable certain rules:\n\n```yaml\n# Tailor will check for violations to all rules except for the following ones\nexcept:\n    - parenthesis-whitespace\n    - lower-camel-case\n```\n\n#### Notes\n\n* *only* is given precedence over *except*\n* Rules that are explicitly included/excluded via CLI will cause the `only`/`except` rules specified in `.tailor.yml` to be ignored\n\n### Specifying output format\n\nTailor allows you to specify the output format (`xcode`/`json`) via the `format` label.\n\nHere is an example showcasing how to specify the output format:\n\n```yaml\n# The output format will now be in JSON\nformat: json\n```\n\n#### Note\n\n* The output format explicitly specified via CLI will cause the output format defined in `.tailor.yml` to be ignored\n\n### Specifying CLI output color scheme\n\nTailor allows you to specify the CLI output color schemes  via the `color` label.  To disable colored output, set `color` to `disable`. To invert the color scheme, set `color` to `invert`.\n\nHere is an example showcasing how to specify the CLI output color scheme:\n\n```yaml\n# The CLI output will not be colored\ncolor: disable\n```\n\n#### Note\n\n* The CLI output color scheme explicitly specified via CLI will cause the output color scheme  defined in `.tailor.yml` to be ignored\n\n## Formatters\n\nTailor's output format may be customized via the `-f`/`--format` option. The Xcode formatter is selected by default.\n\n### Xcode Formatter (default)\n\nThe default `xcode` formatter outputs violation messages according to the format expected by Xcode to be displayed inline within the Xcode Editor Area and as a list in the Log Navigator. This format is also as human-friendly as possible on the console.\n\n```\n$ tailor main.swift\n\n********** /main.swift **********\n/main.swift:1:    warning: [multiple-imports] Imports should be on separate lines\n/main.swift:1:18: warning: [terminating-semicolon] Statements should not terminate with a semicolon\n/main.swift:3:05: warning: [constant-naming] Global Constant should be either lowerCamelCase or UpperCamelCase\n/main.swift:5:07: warning: [redundant-parentheses] Conditional clause should not be enclosed within parentheses\n/main.swift:7:    warning: [terminating-newline] File should terminate with exactly one newline character ('\\n')\n\nAnalyzed 1 file, skipped 0 files, and detected 5 violations (0 errors, 5 warnings).\n```\n\n### [JSON](http://www.json.org) Formatter\n\nThe `json` formatter outputs an array of violation messages for each file, and a `summary` object indicating the parsing results and the violation counts.\n\n```\n$ tailor -f json main.swift\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    {\n      \"path\": \"/main.swift\",\n      \"violations\": [\n        {\n          \"severity\": \"warning\",\n          \"rule\": \"constant-naming\",\n          \"location\": {\n            \"line\": 1,\n            \"column\": 5\n          },\n          \"message\": \"Global Constant should be either lowerCamelCase or UpperCamelCase\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"parsed\": true\n    }\n  ],\n  \"summary\": {\n    \"violations\": 1,\n    \"warnings\": 1,\n    \"analyzed\": 1,\n    \"errors\": 0,\n    \"skipped\": 0\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### HTML Formatter\n\nThe `html` formatter outputs a complete HTML document that should be written to a file.\n\n```\ntailor -f html main.swift > tailor.html\n```\n\n![HTML

Don't import it in your projects).\n\nOpenCombine itself does not have any dependencies. Not even Foundation or Dispatch. If you want to use OpenCombine with Dispatch (for example for using `DispatchQueue` as `Scheduler` for operators like `debounce`, `receive(on:)` etc.), you will need to import both `OpenCombine` and `OpenCombineDispatch`. The same applies to Foundation: if you want to use, for instance, `NotificationCenter` or `URLSession` publishers, you'll need to also import `OpenCombineFoundation`.\n\nIf you develop code for multiple platforms, you may find it more convenient to import the\n`OpenCombineShim` module instead. It conditionally re-exports Combine on Apple platforms (if\navailable), and all OpenCombine modules on other platforms. You can import `OpenCombineShim` only\nwhen using SwiftPM. It is not currently available for CocoaPods.\n\n##### Swift Package Manager\n###### Swift Package\nTo add `OpenCombine` to your [SwiftPM](https://swift.org/package-manager/) package, add the `OpenCombine` package to the list of package and target dependencies in your `Package.swift` file. `OpenCombineDispatch` and `OpenCombineFoundation` products are currently not supported on WebAssembly. If your project targets WebAssembly exclusively, you should omit them from the list of your dependencies. If it targets multiple platforms including WebAssembly, depend on them only on non-WebAssembly platforms with [conditional target dependencies](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0273-swiftpm-conditional-target-dependencies.md).\n\n```swift\ndependencies: [\n    .package(url: \"https://github.com/OpenCombine/OpenCombine.git\", from: \"0.13.0\")\n],\ntargets: [\n    .target(\n        name: \"MyAwesomePackage\",\n        dependencies: [\n            \"OpenCombine\",\n            .product(name: \"OpenCombineFoundation\", package: \"OpenCombine\"),\n            .product(name: \"OpenCombineDispatch\", package: \"OpenCombine\")\n        ]\n    ),\n]\n```\n\n###### Xcode\n`OpenCombine` can also be added as a SwiftPM dependency directly in your Xcode project *(requires Xcode 11 upwards)*.\n\nTo do so, open Xcode, use **File** \u2192 **Swift Packages** \u2192 **Add Package Dependency\u2026**, enter the [repository URL](https://github.com/OpenCombine/OpenCombine.git), choose the latest available version, and activate the checkboxes:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img alt=\"Select the OpenCombine and OpenCombineDispatch targets\" \n\tsrc=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16309982/67618468-bd379f80-f7f8-11e9-917f-e76e878a1aee.png\" width=\"70%\">\n</p>\n\n##### CocoaPods\nTo add `OpenCombine` to a project using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/), add `OpenCombine` and `OpenCombineDispatch` to the list of target dependencies in your `Podfile`. \n\n```ruby\npod 'OpenCombine', '~> 0.13.0'\npod 'OpenCombineDispatch', '~> 0.13.0'\npod 'OpenCombineFoundation', '~> 0.13.0'\n```\n\n#### Debugger Support\n\nThe file `opencombine_lldb.py`  defines some `lldb` type summaries for easier debugging. These type summaries improve the way `lldb` and Xcode display some OpenCombine values.\n\nTo use `opencombine_lldb.py`, figure out its full path. Let's say the full path is `~/projects/OpenCombine/opencombine_lldb.py`. Then the following statement to your `~/.lldbinit` file:\n\n    command script import ~/projects/OpenCombine/opencombine_lldb.py\n\nCurrently, `opencombine_lldb.py` defines type summaries for these types:\n\n- `Subscribers.Demand`\n- That's all for now.\n\n### Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n"

Documentation is generated with [Jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).\n\n## Usage\n\n### Basics\n\nSet `modalPresentationCapturesStatusBarAppearance` to `true` in your modal view controller, and override the `preferredStatusBarStyle` variable to return `.lightContent`.\n\nAdditionally, the `UIScrollView` instances which should be tracked for the swipe-to-dismiss gesture should have their `backgroundColor` set to `.clear`.\n\n### Presentation\n\nThe transition can be called from code or using a storyboard.\n\nTo use via storyboards, just setup a custom segue (`kind` set to `custom`), and set the `class` to `DeckSegue`.\n\nHere\u02bcs a snippet showing usage via code. Just replace `ModalViewController()` with your view controller's class and you\u02bcre good to go.\n\n```swift\nlet modal = ModalViewController()\nlet transitionDelegate = DeckTransitioningDelegate()\nmodal.transitioningDelegate = transitionDelegate\nmodal.modalPresentationStyle = .custom\npresent(modal, animated: true, completion: nil)\n```\n\n### Dismissal\n\nBy default, DeckTransition has a swipe-to-dismiss gesture which is automatically enabled when your modal\u02bcs main `UIScrollView` is scrolled to the top.\n\nYou can opt-out of this behaviour by passing in `false` for the `isSwipeToDismissEnabled` parameter while initialising your `DeckTransitioningDelegate`.\n\n### `UIScrollView` detection\n\nDeckTransition has an internal heuristic to determine which `UIScrollView` should be tracked for the swipe-to-dismiss gesture. In general, this should be sufficient for and cover most use cases.\n\nHowever there are some edge cases, and should you run into one, these can we worked around by making your modal view controller conform to the `DeckTransitionViewControllerProtocol` protocol. More information about this can be found in the documentation page about [UIScrollView detection](https://harshilshah.github.io/DeckTransition/uiscrollview-detection.html).\n\n### Snapshots\n\nFor a variety of reasons, and especially because of iOS 11's safe area layout, DeckTransition uses a snapshot of your presenting view controller's view instead of using the view directly. This view is automatically updated whenever the frame is resized.\n\nHowever, there can be some cases where you might want to update the snapshot view by yourself, and this can be achieved using the following one line snippet:\n\n```swift\n(presentationController as? DeckSnapshotUpdater)?.requestPresentedViewSnapshotUpdate()\n```\n\nAll this does is request the presentation controller to update the snapshot.\n\nYou can also choose to update snapshot directly from the presenting view controller, as follows:\n\n```swift\n(presentedViewController?.presentationController as? DeckSnapshotUpdater)?.requestPresentedViewSnapshotUpdate()\n```\n\nIt's worth noting that updating the snapshot is an expensive process and should only be used if necessary, for example if you are updating your entire app's theme.\n\n## Apps Using DeckTransition\n- [Petty](https://zachsim.one/projects/petty) by [Zach Simone](https://twitter.com/zachsimone)\n- [Bitbook](https://bitbookapp.com) by [Sammy Gutierrez](https://sammygutierrez.com)\n- [What's Open for iOS](https://git.gmu.edu/srct/whats-open-ios) by [Mason SRCT](https://srct.gmu.edu/)\n- [Manabi Reader](https://reader.manabi.io) by [Alex Ehlke](https://twitter.com/aehlke)\n\nFeel free to submit a PR if you\u2019re using this library in your apps\n\n## Author\n\nWritten by [Harshil Shah](https://twitter.com/HarshilShah1910)\n\n## License\n\nDeckTransition is available under the MIT license.

For this, execute the following two commands\nin Terminal.app:\n```\ndefaults write ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist EnableBundles -bool true\ndefaults write ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist BundleCompatibilityVersion 4\n```\n\nNext, perform the following steps:\n\n* Download the plugin if you haven't done so already\n* Navigate in Finder to `~/Library/Mail/` (where `~` means: your home directory)\n* If a `Bundles` folder doesn't yet exist, create an empty one\n* Extract the downloaded ZIP file and copy `QuoteFix.mailbundle` into the Bundles folder\n* Lastly, quit Mail.app if it's running, and start it up again.\n\nIn case you run into any problems, or want to uninstall QuoteFix, just\nremove QuoteFix.mailbundle from the bundle-folder and restart Mail.app.\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter installation, QuoteFix is enabled. It will perform its magic\nautomatically when you reply to, or forward, messages.\n\nThe behaviour of the plug-in is customizable via its preferences. QuoteFix\nhas it's own preference pane in the preferences window of Mail.app. Most\npreferences speak for themselves, or have a useful tooltip which pops up\nwhen you hover the cursor above it.\n\nIf you temporarily want to turn off QuoteFix, but don't want to uninstall\nit, check off the *QuoteFix is enabled* checkbox. As of version 2.3.1,\n(de)activating QuoteFix can be done from a menu item in the Mail menu. You\ncould use [the standard way of assigning a keyboard shortcut to a menu item\nin Mac OS X](http://lifehacker.com/343328/create-a-keyboard-shortcut-for-any-menu-action-in-any-program) to enable or disable QuoteFix with a keyboard shortcut.\n\n## Customized Attributions\n\nQuoteFix also provides the ability to define your own attribution lines\n(the first line of a reply/forward, usually looking something like\n`On SOME DATE, at SOME TIME, SOMEONE wrote:`).\n\nCustomized attributions work by way of templates: you define a template in\nthe preferences, and parts of the template will \u2013 at the time of replying\nor forwarding \u2013 be replaced by values reflecting parts of the message you\nare replying to or forwarding.\n\nTemplating works by replacing template variables with values. A template\nvariable looks like this: `${VARIABLE}`. It will be replaced with a value\ndepending on what `VARIABLE` contains.\n\nA (non-exhaustive) list of variables you can use:\n\n<table border=0>\n    <tr>\n        <td valign=\"top\"><code>${message.from}</code></td>\n        <td>\n            Name and e-mail address of sender of message:<br/>\n            <i>Your Friend &lt;yourfriend@example.com&gt;</i>\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td valign=\"top\"><code>${message.from.name}</code></td>\n        <td>\n            Name of sender of message:<br/>\n            <i>Your Friend</i>\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td valign=\"top\"><code>${message.from.email}</code></td>\n        <td>\n            E-mail address of sender of message:<br/>\n            <i>yourfriend@example.com</i>\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td valign=\"top\"><code>${message.to}</code></td>\n        <td>\n            Your e-mail address (this is the address that was used for\n            the message to reach you). This is more like the\n            <code>Delivered-To</code> header than the <code>To</code>\n            header (for that, see <code>${message.recipients}</code>)\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td valign=\"top\"><code>${message.recipients}</code></td>\n        <td>\n            A list of all the recipients of the message, as mentioned in\n            both the <code>To</code> and <code>Cc</code> headers.\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td valign=\"top\"><code>${message.recipients.to}</code></td>\n        <td>\n            A list of the recipients of the message mentioned in\n            the <code>To</code> header.\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td valign=\"top\"><code>${message.recipients.cc}</code></td>\n        <td>\n            A list of the recipients of the message mentioned in\n            the <code>Cc</code> header.\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td valign=\"top\"><code>${message.subject}</code></td>\n        <td>The subject of the message.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td valign=\"top\">\n            <code>${message.sent}</code><br/>\n            <code>${message.received}</code>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n            Sent/received timestamps. If you want more finegrained\n            control over formatting timestamps, these variables split\n            into separate fields: <code>year</code>, <code>month</code>,\n            <code>day</code>, <code>hour</code>, <code>hour12</code>,\n            <code>ampm</code>, <code>minute</code>, <code>second</code>,\n            <code>weeknumber</code>, <code>monthshort</code>,\n            <code>monthlong</code>, <code>dayshort</code>,\n            <code>daylong</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>time</code>.<br/>\n            Use these like so: <code>${message.sent.year}</code>.\n            <p><a href=\"#advanced-datetime-formatting\">See below for more advanced date/time formatting\n                options.</a></p>\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\nIf you want even more freedom in formatting attribution lines, there's an\nexperimental feature (which can be enabled in the *Advanced* preferences)\nwhich enables conditional statements, string/date formatting, and much\nmore. This is based on a modified version of the [pyratemp](http://www.simple-is-better.org/template/pyratemp.html) templating\nlibrary for Python written by Roland Koebler.\n\nA small example of what's possible:\n```\nFrom: ${message.from}\n{% if message.recipients.to %}\n To: ${message.recipients.to.join(\"; \", \"name\")}\n{% end %}\n{% if message.recipients.cc %}\n Cc: ${message.recipients.cc.join(\"; \", \"name\")}\n{% end %}\nSubject: ${message.subject.lower()}\nSent-Date: ${message.sent.strftime(\"%d-%m-%Y\")}\n```\n\nYou can also enable HTML-formatting for your custom attributions. For this\nto work, the (outgoing) message format should be *Rich Text*. You can have\nQuoteFix automatically convert a message to Rich Text if your attribution\nshould be interpreted in HTML. Otherwise, QuoteFix will issue a warning.\n\nIf you want to mimic the attribution generated by Outlook, try this (with\nHTML-formatting enabled):\n```\n<b>From:</b> ${message.from}\n<b>Date:</b> ${message.received}\n<b>To:</b> ${message.to}\n<b>Subject:</b> ${message.subject}\n```\nWhen you're editing your customized attribution, QuoteFix will generate an\napproximate preview as tooltip of the text field you're entering the\nattribution in.\n\n## Advanced date/time formatting\n\nIf you want even more finegrained control over the formatting of dates and\ntimes, you can enable *\"advanced templating\"* in the Advanced preferences,\nafter which date/time variables like `message.sent` and `message.received`\nwill have `.format()` and `.strftime()` methods with which you can format the\noutput of the objects.\n\nFunctionally, these two methods perform the same operation \u2013 namely\nformatting date/time objects \u2013 the difference is in the formatting strings\nused:\n\n*  `.strftime()` uses the common Unix function with the same name for\n   formatting. [Look here for more information](http://docs.python.org/library/time.html#time.strftime).\n*  `.format()` uses the Unicode date format patterns. [Look here for more\n   information](http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-10.html#Date_Format_Patterns).\n\nAn example:\n```\n${message.sent.format(\"EEE MMM dd yyyy HH:mm:ss\")}\n```\nThis will output: `Sun Nov 06 2011 10:19:34`\n\nSimilarly, with `.strftime()`:\n```\n${message.sent.strftime(\"%a %b %d %Y %H:%M:%S\")}\n```\n\nHowever: the output will be generated in the current locale, which means\nthat it will be formatted according to your local language settings.\n\nTo change this, both methods accept a second argument: a locale\nidentifier. You can use it to convert the output to a certain locale,\ninstead of the default locale (which can be changed in the *System\nPreferences* of Mac OS X: *Language & Text > Formats*).\n\nThe same example as above, but with a different locale:\n```\n${message.sent.format(\"EEE MMM dd yyyy HH:mm:ss\", 'fr_FR')}\n```\nThe output: `dim. nov. 06 2011 10:19:34`\n\nIf you want the default format, just in a different locale, use the\n`.locale()` method:\n```\n${message.sent.locale('fr_FR')}\n```\n\n## Enabling/disabling the plug-in\n\nQuoteFix has various ways of turning off its behaviour, short of\nuninstalling it:\n\n* You can turn QuoteFix off from its preferences; this will disable the plug-in until you enable it again;\n* You can quickly turn the plug-in on/off from the Mail menu. If you want, you can even assign a keyboard shortcut to this menu item from System Preferences;\n* You can toggle the enable (or disable) status of QuoteFix for a single message by pressing down `Option` whilst initiating a Reply/Forward action. That is:\n    * When QuoteFix is **disabled**, pressing `Option` will *enable* QuoteFix for that particular message only;\n    * Likewise: when QuoteFix is **enabled**, pressing `Option` will *disable* QuoteFix for that particular message only;\n\n## Building the plug-in\n\nIf you want to build the plug-in yourself, ideally you need to use a non-system Python interpreter (although not *strictly* necessary if you want to use the plug-in on your system only).\n\nI use Python 2.7.5 as installed by [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). I also use [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv/) to create a clean environment in which to build the plug-in.\n\nMake sure the following requirements are installed:\n```\npip install pyobjc # might take some time\npip install py2app\n```\n\nNext, clone the repository:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/robertklep/quotefixformac.git\n```\n\nAnd build the plug-in:\n```\ncd quotefixformac\npython setup.py py2app\n```\n\nThis will build the plug-in, which can be located in `dist/`.\n\n## Licence & copyright\n\nThis plugin is written by Robert Klep and is provided \"as-is\", without any\nwarranties whatsoever.\n\nQuoteFix source, downloads and support is hosted by GitHub at\nhttps://github.com/robertklep/quotefixformac\n\nQuoteFix uses the Sparkle framework from Andy Matuschak to provide software\nupdates, which comes with the following permission notice:\n\n>  Copyright (c) 2006 Andy Matuschak Permission is hereby granted, free of\n>  charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated\n>  documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\n>  restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy,\n>  modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\n>  the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to\n>  do so, subject to the following conditions: The above copyright notice\n>  and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or\n>  substantial portions of the Software.

  "repo": "BigZaphod/Chameleon",
  "language": "Objective-C",
  "readme_contents": "# Chameleon\n\nChameleon is a port of Apple's UIKit (and some minimal related frameworks) to Mac OS X. It is meant to be as much of a drop-in replacement for the real UIKit as possible. It also adapts some iOS user interface conventions to the Mac (such as UIAlertView being represented by NSAlert) so that apps built using Chameleon have as much chance as possible of feeling at home on the desktop with relatively little porting effort.\n\nChameleon requires OS X 10.6 or higher. Apps built with it have been proven to be acceptable to Apple for the Mac App Store. Chameleon was first built by [The Iconfactory](http://iconfactory.com/) to unify the codebase of [Twitterrific](http://www.twitterrific.com/) for both Mac and iOS.\n\nThe UIKit implementation mostly targets iOS 3.2's version of UIKit. Not everything is implemented at this time, but a surprisingly large subset is. There are some methods and/or behaviors from later versions of iOS implemented as well. Any UIKit methods that were deprecated around iOS 3.2 are not included.\n\nAs a general rule, if Apple's UIKit behaves in a certain way for some piece of code, that behavior should be considered correct even if you don't like how Apple's version does things. If Chameleon's behavior differs, Chameleon is wrong. That said, before immediately blaming problems on Chameleon, be absolutely sure that your code is, in fact, behaving differently than it would on Apple's implementation. Also be certain that there isn't a good reason Chameleon's behavior may differ. (An example of a difference that is intended is the behavior of UIAlertView - in Apple's UIKit, it is a UIView and has certain expected behaviors and capabilities as a result. In Chameleon, it is still a UIView, but it is presented as an NSAlert and that is simply how it should be to achieve a more native feel but it also means any UIView tricks that may have worked with a UIAlertView on iOS will not work the same under Chameleon. UIActionSheet and UITextView are other examples of areas that have sometimes large but intentional differences.)\n\n## Usage\n\nChameleon is actually a collection of several frameworks, the largest of which is UIKit. The others are mostly stubs that made porting simple demos and test apps from iOS very simple with minimal (in some cases, zero) code changes and may or may not be necessary for you.\n\nThe Xcode projects build embeddable frameworks which can then be bundled within your own app's bundle and distributed in a self-contained way.\n\n## Design\n\nThe UIKit port in Chameleon starts at a very low level and attempts to go so far as to even route UIEvent objects along a similar path starting in the single UIApplication instance and getting routed from there to the correct UIWindows and UIViews.\n\nThe interface between AppKit's NSViews and NSWindows and Chameleon's UIWindow and UIViews occurs at the \"screen\" level. UIKitView is an NSView which you add to your NSView hierarchy in whatever way you want. The UIKitView hosts a UIScreen instance which is home to UIKit's interface elements.\n\nEach UIWindow belongs to a UIScreen, and UIViews must exist on UIWindows. This should mostly work the same as you've come to expect on iOS. An important thing to note is that Mac applications often have more than one window. If you use more than one UIKitView in your app, be aware that this means your application now has more than one UIScreen and as a result some methods such as [UIScreen mainScreen] may suddenly do unexpected things. When porting Twitterrific from iOS, this was one source of unexpected bugs as a few things were making assumptions about there only being a single, main screen since that is normal on current iOS devices.\n\nOnce a UIKitView exists and there's a UIScreen available to work with, your code can proceed to build a UIWindow and UIViews on top of it and be largely unaware that it is actually running on OSX instead of iOS. For those cases where you need to customize some UI, `UIUserInterfaceIdiomDesktop` has been added so that your code can differentiate between running on a pad, phone, or desktop in a consistent way. To keep code cross platform, the following is a good way to structure things so that Apple's UIKit doesn't encounter the unknown `UIUserInterfaceIdiomDesktop` symbol when compiling for iOS:\n\n\tif (UI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM() == UIUserInterfaceIdiomPhone) {\n\t// iPhone\n\t} else if (UI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM() == UIUserInterfaceIdiomPad) {\n\t// iPad\n\t} else {\n\t// Mac\n\t}\n\n(You can always use #ifdef or other compile-time approaches for platform differentiation, too - especially since a Mac app built with Chameleon doesn't need to adapt to multiple UI idioms at runtime the way a universal iOS app does. I just find it nice to have a similar pattern for all 3 idioms - but maybe that's just me.)\n\nYou can usually just create an instance of your iOS app's UIApplicationDelegate object and then pass it into UIKitView's helper method `-launchApplicationWithDelegate:afterDelay:` which will emulate the startup process of an iOS app (it will even attempt to show a Default.png if a delay is given). You might perform this step in your NSApplicationDelegate object's `-applicationDidFinishLaunching:` method. It is not necessary to use UIKitView's helper method to \"launch\" your app, but it can be a good way to get started.\n\nGenerally the interfaces to the classes are the same as Apple's documented interfaces. Some objects have additional methods that are useful for OS X and are defined in `(ClassName)AppKitIntegration.h` headers which are not included by the standard `UIKit.h` header. To easily include all AppKit extensions into your code, import `UIKit/AppKitIntegration.h` when compiling on OS X. There are also a couple of non-standard UI classes defined such as UIKey and UIViewAdapter that I designed out of necessity. (Keyboard handling in particular is a weak spot of Apple's current UIKit and so I developed my own rough API in place of anything \"official\" being documented by Apple.)\n\n## Examples\n\nRight now there's hardly any demos or examples or documentation. There's a simple app called BigApple in the Examples folder which might be enough to get started. It also shows how the UIKit Xcode project can be referenced from another Xcode project and setup as a dependency so that it is built automatically when the BigApple project is built.\n\n## Authors\n\nThe Chameleon project was created by Sean Heber (Twitter: [@BigZaphod](http://twitter.com/BigZaphod/)) of The Iconfactory and he wrote nearly all of the initial version over several months. Craig Hockenberry (Twitter: [@chockenberry](http://twitter.com/chockenberry/)) was the first user/tester of Chameleon and found many holes and edge cases in the first implementation.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2011, The Iconfactory.

  "readme_contents": "## About\n\nHistorically, Macintosh computers running macOS have been popular with brain imaging scientists. Since macOS runs Unix, users can often use the same tools on their laptop as the Linux workstations and super computers used for large datasets. However, this trend may change. First, the new [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://www.nemotos.net/?p=1481) has allowed Windows computers to seamlessly run Unix tools. Second, recent Macintosh computers have switched from Intel x86-64 processors to the ARM-based M1 `Apple Silicon`. This new architecture must translate existing code, and optimal performance will require tools to be recompiled. These two factors may make scientists reconsider future purchases. This page examines the potential for Apple Silicon to be used in brain imaging. \n\n## TL;DR\n\nUnless you are a developer, I would strongly discourage scientists from purchasing an Apple Silicon computer in the short term. Productive work will require core tools to be ported. In the longer term, this architecture could have a profound impact on science. In particular if Apple develops servers that exploit the remarkable power efficiency of their CPUs (competing with AWS Graviton) and leverage the Metal language and GPUs for compute tasks (competing with NVidia's Tesla products and CUDA language).\n\n## Limitations facing Apple Silicon\n\nThe infrastructure scientists depend on is not yet available for this architecture. Here are some of the short term limitations:\n\n - Native [R](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2020/11/02/will-r-work-on-apple-silicon/index.html) can use the unstable [R-devel 4.1](https://mac.r-project.org). However, [RStudio](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/8652) will require [gdb](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857).\n - [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/36617) does not yet natively support Apple Silicon.\n - Python natively supports Apple Silicon. However, [some popular neuroimaging libraries like DIPY do not yet natively support this architecture](https://github.com/tee-ar-ex/trx-python/issues/23).\n - Scientific modules of Python, R, and Julia require a [Fortran compiler](https://walkingrandomly.com/?p=6696), which is currently only available in experimental form. \n - While Apple's C Clang compiler generates fast native code, many scientific tools will need to [wait](https://www.theregister.com/2020/11/18/apple_silicon_m1_mac_compatibility/) until gcc and gFortran compilers are available.\n - Tools like VirtualBox, VMware Fusion, Boot Camp and Parallels do not support x86-64 operating systems on Apple Silicon. Many users rely on these tools for using Windows and Linux programs on their macOS computers. Parallels and VMware Fusion Tech Preview support ARM-based Windows and Linux.\n - Docker can [support Apple Silicon](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/apple-silicon/). However, attempts to run Intel-based containers on Apple Silicon machines can crash as QEMU sometimes fails to run the container. These containers are popular with many neuroimaging tools. \n - MATLAB is used by many scientific tools, including SPM. While [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/641925-is-matlab-supported-on-apple-silicon-macs) works in translation, it is not yet available natively (and mex files will need to be recompiled). Note that as of [May 5, 2022](https://blogs.mathworks.com/matlab/2022/05/05/exploring-the-matlab-beta-for-native-apple-silicon/) beta support for the M1 has been provided.\n - [FSL](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe?A2=ind2011&L=FSL&O=D&X=E5496FE3694704BA21&Y=rorden%40sc.edu&P=163954) does not yet natively support this architecture. While code may work in translation, creating some native tools must wait for compilers and libraries to be updated. This will likely require months.\n - The M1 only has four high performance cores, while the M1 Max and M1 Pro are have only eight. Most neuroimaging pipelines combine sequential tasks that only require a single core (where the M1 excels) as well as parallel tasks. Those parallel tasks could exploit a CPU with more cores (as shown in the pigz and niimath tests below). Bear in mind that this mixture of serial and parallel code faces [Amdahls law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law), with [diminishing returns](https://neurostars.org/t/fmriprep-multi-threading-benchmark-results/17622/2) for extra cores.\n - The original M1 has a maximum of 16 Gb of RAM. Neuroimaging datasets often have [large memory demands](https://neurostars.org/t/fmriprep-multi-threading-benchmark-results/17622) (especially multi-band accelerated functional, resting-state and diffusion datasets). The M1 Max resolves this issue, with up to 64 Gb of RAM.\n - In general, the M1 and Intel-based Macs have identical OpenGL compatibility, with the M1 providing better performance than previous integrated solutions. However, there are corner cases that may break OpenGL tools. Here I describe four limitations. First, OpenGL geometry shaders are [not supported](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/issues/2247) (there is no Metal equivalent). Second, the new retina displays support [wide color](https://support.apple.com/guide/motion/intro-to-wide-color-gamut-and-hdr-motn3f5342e9/mac) with [16 bitsPerSample](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimagerep/1533157-bitspersample) that can cause issues for code that assumes 32-bit RGBA textures (such as the [text](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/samplecode/CocoaGL/Introduction/Intro.html) in this Apple example code). Third, textures can be handled [differently](https://blog.dengine.net/2021/01/wonders-and-mysteries-of-the-m1/). Fourth, use of the GL_INT_2_10_10_10_REV data type will cripple performance (tested on macOS 11.2). This is unfortunate, as [Apple advocated for this datatype once upon a time](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/3DDrawing/Conceptual/OpenGLES_ProgrammingGuide/TechniquesforWorkingwithVertexData/TechniquesforWorkingwithVertexData.html). In this case, code msut be changed to use the less compact GL_HALF_FLOAT which is natively supported by the M1 GPU. This impacts neuroimaging scientists visualizing [DTI tractography](https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/surfice:MainPage#Scripting_tracks) where GPU resources can be overwhelmed.\n \nThere are some inherent weaknesses to using Macintosh for brain imaging:\n\n - NVidia graphics cards and therefore the CUDA language are not supported. Tools like [eddy](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/eddy), [Probtrackx](https://users.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/~moisesf/Probtrackx_GPU/index.html) and [Bedpostx](https://users.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/~moisesf/Bedpostx_GPU/Installation.html) are dramatically accelerated by this technology. Further, CUDA supports both single and double-precision computations, whereas Apple's competing Metal currently only supports single-precision computations. Single precision is sufficient for many tasks (e.g. probabilistic solutions like eddy, Probtrackx, Bedpostx), but is a limitation for some statistics.\n - While Linux is open-source, Apple's software is not. While some of Apple's attempts to protect users computers may be well intentioned, they have had [unintended consequences](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/macos-big-sur-launch-appears-to-cause-temporary-slowdown-in-even-non-big-sur-macs/). A primary tenet of science is replication, and therefore transparent open source code has strong appeal. Scientists often share applications they develop with each other, and recent security features introduced by Apple can challenge this. Scientists, hobbyists and others who are not full time macOS developers will  find it difficult and expensive to support  the [complex](https://sigpipe.macromates.com/2020/macos-catalina-slow-by-design/) security features of macOS. Features like [Gatekeeper Path Randomization](https://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2016/06/29/sierra-and-gatekeeper-path-randomization/), the requirement for all native Apple Silicon executables to be code signed (locally with `codesign -s - exename`), quarantine of untrusted libraries (e.g. SPM and FSL both require calls like `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine *.dylib`) and [application notarization](https://github.com/neurolabusc/NotarizeC) (which requires a $99 per year developer subscription) are all impediments for scientific applications.\n - Apple's Developer Tools are not competitive. Despite paying annual fees, 3rd party developers are treated unprofessionally: issues logged with the Feedback Assistant get no response, no work arounds are provided, developer documentation is poor, changes are not documented (so exisitng documentation is often inaccurate), major bugs are not documented and often left unfixed for years. In brief, the virtuous cycle of development and refinement that is seen in open source and other professional projects is absent. Despite being one of the worlds most profitable companies, Apple appears to have made virtually no investment in creating mutually beneficial relationships with developers and scientists. Specific examples described below include the hugely popular NumPy and SciPy projects, which have defaulted to functional but unoptimized solutions on Apple devices due to lack of support. Therefore, while artificial benchmarks may showcase the potential of Apple hardware, users will often being using inefficient solutions. This means that the theoretical potential of Apple systems is rarely realized in practice. Resolution requires Apple to refocus or expand their developer ecosystem engineering team. Recently (Nov 2021) there is sign of hope, with Apple's Developer Ecosystem Engineering suggesting patches for NumPy and NumPy 1.2.1 enabling [Apple's Accelerate Framework](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/66d33faabf1f19d4b192c38e927dfa727b0ed61f/doc/source/release/1.21.0-notes.rst).\n - Recent changes to macOS mean it should be avoided for [visual stimulation, DAQ digital/analog i/o, and running real time data collection](http://psychtoolbox.org/requirements.html). Therefore, scientists may find macOS computers are only suitable for specific niches, and are not good for all purposes.\n - Apple has [deprecated OpenGL](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12894/apple-deprecates-opengl-across-all-oses) encouraging developers to move to their modern Metal framework. Many scientific tools use OpenGL, and it is unrealistic to expect these developers to port their proven, robust tools. A few of the popular scientific tools that rely on OpenGL includes FreeSurfer, Connectome Workbench, AFNI, FSLeyes, Matlab, and Slicer 3D. It should be noted that OpenGL support for Apple Silicon is very good. It is unclear whether `deprecated` means `will not be updated` or `will be removed in an upcoming version of macOS`. If OpenGL support is removed, the operating system is no longer viable for neuroimaging research. Without clarification, developers of scientific software must seriously consider the investment they should make in supporting this operating system. \n \n \n## Potential for Apple Silicon\n\nInitial reviews have suggested [Apple's M1 CPU has outstanding performance](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested). It includes [Rosetta2](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested/6), that will translate most x86-64 programs to Apple Silicon (AArch64) instructions providing seamless operation and reasonable performance. Indeed, as illustrated below the compatibility and performance of Rosetta2 is very impressive. There are specific features that are appealing for neuroimaging.\n\n - Of particular note for brain scientists is the incredible memory bandwidth and the ability of [single cores](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested) to efficiently leverage this resource. Our field has large datasets that tend to be memory rather than computation bound (the [memory wall](https://www.blosc.org/docs/StarvingCPUs-CISE-2010.pdf)).\n - While some operations lend themselves to the CPU, others are ideal for the GPU. An analogy would be transport via jet plane (CPU: moving a small amount fast), or super tanker (GPU: moving a huge amount with longer latency). However, many operations require sharing data between the [CPU and GPU](https://www.blosc.org/docs/StarvingCPUs-CISE-2010.pdf) so  [memory transfer](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe?A2=ind2004&L=FSL&P=R99017&X=F11DC25F019ED07848&Y=rorden%40sc.edu) can be the bottleneck. In contrast, the Apple M1 chip has unified memory, allowing the GPU and CPU to share memory without penalty.\n\n## Testing\n\nFour computers were tested:\n\n - MacBook Pro (2018) with Intel [i5-8259u](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/135935/intel-core-i5-8259u-processor-6m-cache-up-to-3-80-ghz.html) (28w) four-core, eight-thread, maximum bandwidth 37.5 GB/s, integrated GPU. Cache 64 kb/core L1, 256 kb/core L2, 6 mb shared L3. \n - Ubuntu 18.04 Intel [i7-8700k](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/126684/intel-core-i7-8700k-processor-12m-cache-up-to-4-70-ghz.html) (95w) six-core, twelve-thread, maximum bandwidth 41.6 GB/s, with NVidia GTX [1080 Ti](https://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-1080-ti/specifications) (250w) GPU. Cache 64 kb/core L1, 256 kb/core L2, 12 mb shared L3. \n - Ubuntu 20.04 AMD [Ryzen 9 3900X](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-9-3900x) (105w) twelve-core, twenty-four-thread, maximum bandwidth 47.68 GB/s,  with NVidia GTX [1080 Ti](https://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-1080-ti/specifications) (250w) GPU.  Cache 64 kb/core L1, 512 kb/core L2, 64 mb shared L3. Tests were run on a RAM disk to maximize memory performance.\n - MacBook Air (2020) with Apple Silicon [M1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1) (~15w) with four fast cores plus four efficiency cores, maximum bandwidth 68.25GB/s, and integrated GPU (8 Gb RAM, 256 Gb SSD, 7 GPUs).  Cache 320 kb/core L1, 12 mb shared L2. Note this configuration does not have active cooling, so performance is thermally constrained (for example, the [Mac mini M1](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/11/24/apple-silicon-m1-mac-mini-review---speed-today-and-a-promise-of-more-later) is faster for sustained workloads).\n\n## AFNI\n\n[AFNI](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov) is a popular software suite for brain imaging. It is a collection of executables written in C. It can be compiled to run natively on the Apple Silicon CPUs.\n\nAFNI provides a [`Bigger Speed Test`](https://sscc.nimh.nih.gov/afni/doc/misc/afni_speed/index_html) which a [1.67 GHz G4 PowerBook (released in 2005)](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_g4/specs/powerbook_g4_1.67_15.html) laptop was able to complete in 3081 seconds (this is a nice reference, as it was the fastest non-Intel based laptop sold by Apple prior to the M1-based Macs). In contrast, the M1 completes this in 47 seconds. In the graph below, the computation time is presented on the vertical axis (with less time indicating faster performance) and the number of threads shown on the horizontal axis. In this test, the M1 shows very similar performance for using just the four performance cores versus also using the efficiency cores. All systems show diminishing returns for additional cores, presumably reflecting both Amdahl's law and that the memory bandwidth is being saturated. Despite this effect, the sheer number of cores in the 3900X yields the best performance. \n\n![afni_bench](afni_bench.png)\n\nThe graph below shows the total time to compute the [AFNI_data6 s01.ap.simple script](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/htmldoc/background_install/unix_tutorial/misc/install.data.html). This is a complete pipeline, analyzing fMRI activity observed in 452 volumes of data. Some programs like 3dClustSim use OpenMP acceleration (where the 12 cores of the Ryzen help), while many stages are single-threaded. This is a nice demonstration of the real world performance of this architecture for a typical dataset.\n\n![afni](afni.png)\n\n## dcm2niix\n\n[dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix) is used to convert the complicated DICOM format used in medical imaging to the simple NIfTI format popular in scientific neuroimaging. While the DICOM format allows several forms of image compression, images are typically stored uncompressed. Image conversion typically only requires a small amount of time relative to the subsequent processing and statistics. However, since dcm2niix can be easily compiled for the M1, it is an easy tool to benchmark. Here we convert [1296 DICOM uncompressed images (1.6 Gb)](https://osf.io/3m7ph/) to uncompressed NIfTI (dcm2niix can use pigz for compression, which we evaluate separately). The graph below shows conversion times, with lower values indicating faster performance. \n\n![dcm2niix](dcm2niix.png)\n\n## Fortran\n\nAs previously noted, many scientific tools require a Fortran compiler. An experimental build of the open source gFortran compiler has just been released. The preliminary performance for this [nascent gFortran tool is described on a separate page](./fortran/README.md).  \n\n## FSL\n\nfslmaths handles much of the internal processing for FSL, and is a popular stand-alone tool for computation. While [FSL](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe?A2=ind2011&L=FSL&O=D&X=E5496FE3694704BA21&Y=rorden%40sc.edu&P=163954) is not yet compiled for Apple Silicon, translations run seamlessly. On the other hand, the [niimath](https://github.com/rordenlab/niimath) clone can be compiled for Apple Silicon.  \n\nThe graph shows the geometric mean for four computations (de-meaning, temporal filtering, Gaussian smoothing, image dilation) with lower values indicating faster performance. `FSL` denotes the performance of fslmaths. `Serial` is the performance of niimath using a single thread. `Parallel` is niimath using OpenMP. The native serial M1 code is faster than the translated code, but this is not the case for the parallel code. This might reflect that both are using the native pigz for compression, and note that gcc was used to compile the translated code while clang was used for the native code (perhaps OpenMP is not as finely tuned with clang).\n \n![fslmaths](fslmaths.png)\n\n\n## MRIcroGL\n\n[MRIcroGL](https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/mricrogl:MainPage) is a used for visualization of neuroimaging data supporting [volume rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_rendering). It is available for Linux, Windows and macOS. For macOS, a universal binary is provided that runs natively on both x86-64 and Apple Silicon. For Windows and Linux, OpenGL is used for visualization and some compute. For macOS versions are available for both OpenGL and Metal. The latter was used here (while deprecated on macOS, OpenGL performs well, albeit a bit slower). Testing involved a [digimorph desert iguana](http://digimorph.org/specimens/Dipsosaurus_dorsalis/) that used two 512mb textures of GPU memory. \n\n![mricrogl](iguana.jpg)\n\nThe first test examines the CPU performance, looking at the loading, scaling and transformation of the image data. Two times are reported for native code on the M1: code generated by the [beta release of FPC](https://www.freepascal.org) with optimization disabled (due to known optimization bugs), the second using Apple's mature [LLVM/Clang](https://wiki.freepascal.org/LLVM) with optimization enabled.\n\n![mricrogl](mricrogl.png)\n\nThe second test examines the GPU compute performance, looking at generation of the intensity [gradients](https://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/mricrogl/gradients). While many have been critical of Intel integrated graphics, the i5-8259u includes the [Iris Plus Graphics 655](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Graphics_Technology) with 128 MB eDRAM and 48 execution units (whereas most contemporary Intel GPUs had no eDRAM and half the number of execution units). The 8700K and 3900X both use the powerful 250w NVidia GTX 1080 Ti. In this light, the combination of the Metal compute language and the M1 GPU provides compelling performance.\n\n\n![mricrogl](mricrogl_gpu.png)\n\n## NiBabel\n\n[NiBabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/) is a collection of neuroimaging related Python scripts and utilities. It provides [benchmarks](https://nipy.org/nibabel/reference/nibabel.benchmarks.html) for performance and regression testing.\n\n[Python natively supports the M1](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#download) including native support for many popular libraries including numpy and scipy (though not [DIPY](https://github.com/tee-ar-ex/trx-python/issues/23)). Users will want to ensure that they install numpy 1.23 or later [to exploit SIMD optimizations](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/17989)).\n\nNote that many Python libraries do not yet support this hardware, so in practice you will have to disable this version for many tasks (`conda deactivate`). It does seem like packages that do not install with `pip` can be installed using commands of the form [`conda install opencv`](https://github.com/neurolabusc/AppleSiliconForNeuroimaging/issues/2).\n\nThe graph shows the geometric mean for the benchmarks with lower values indicating faster performance.\n \n![nibabel](nibabel.png)\n\n## OpenMP\n\nMany computational tasks can be run in parallel, leveraging the fact that modern CPUs and GPUs have many independent cores. [OpenMP](https://openmp.llvm.org) is a popular library for enabling parallel computation (e.g. afni, freesurfer, FSL and niimath). Here we test a [simple benchmark](OPENMP.md) that simulates computing a 1D Gaussian blur for a large 4D resting-state dataset. While Apple does not provide OpenMP with its compilers, it is simple to add this library ([as described here](OPENMP.md)). For the Intel and AMD CPUs, both the gcc and Clang/LLVM compilers were tested. They performed similarly, so Clang times are provided for all computers.\n\nThe graph shows the geometric mean for the benchmarks with lower values indicating faster performance. Serial shows the performance for a single core, while parallel uses all available threads (24 for the 3900X and 8 for the 8259U and M1). One can also explicitly specify the number of threads. This reveals that SMT (for the 8259U and 3900X) and the efficiency cores (for the M1) provide little benefit (not shown). The main message here is that the M1 performance cores show good parallel scaling.\n \n![openmp](openmp.png)\n\n## pigz\n\nThe GZip compression format is a staple of neuroimaging, with NIfTI images often stored in GZip format. The compression is slow (relative to decompression), but the pigz tool can use multiple threads to accelerate compression. Indeed, popular tools like AFNI and dcm2niix can use pigz. A previous review of the Apple M1 CPU examined [pigz](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/hands-on-with-the-apple-m1-a-seriously-fast-x86-competitor/), however that review only examined the conventional version. Here we compare both conventional pigz with an accelerated version using the [CloudFlare zlib](https://github.com/cloudflare/zlib) which leverages dedicated hardware in both Intel and ARM computers. Here we tested compression of the [Silesia compression corpus](http://sun.aei.polsl.pl/~sdeor/index.php?page=silesia) using a simple [script](https://github.com/neurolabusc/pigz-bench-python).\n\nThe graph shows compression performance as megabytes per second, with higher values indicating faster performance. The horizontal axes shows the number of threads, with actual values for 1..4 and 5 representing the use of all available threads (e.g. 8 threads for the M1 but 24 for the 3900X). The shaded color for each line illustrates the performance difference between the standard pigz (bottom of shaded region) and the CloudFlare pigz (top of shaded region). The `M1pro` entry refers to the base model M1 Pro CPU (with 6 performance cores and 2 efficiency cores).\n\n![pigz](pigz.png)\n\n## POSIX Threads (pthreads)\n\n[POSIX Threads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_Threads) is a low-level method for handling parallel threads. Here we test C-Ray a simple raytracing benchmark by [John Tsiombikas](https://github.com/jtsiomb) that provides a measure of parallel floating point CPU performance. The small size means it can be [contained in cache](http://www.sgidepot.co.uk/c-ray.html), so it is not a great measure of typical performance with real world datasets. On the other hand, it is very portable and has been used for many years. This allows us to make historical comparisons. Specifically, here we provide data for [SGI Depot Test 3](http://www.sgidepot.co.uk/c-ray.html) where the scene 'sphfract' is rendered at 1024x768 with 8X oversampling. This allows you to compare the Apple M1 to vintage CPUs like the IBM POWER3, Sun UltraSPARC IIIi, DEC Alpha 21164, Intel Itanium, and the vaunted SGI Origin350. The table below only includes the performance for the M1, 3900X and [SGI O2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGI_O2). In many ways, the O2 can be seen as the M1 of its day: unified memory shared for compute and graphics with vertical integration of software and CPU. The M1 is 192 times faster than the fastest O2 and 962 times faster than the base model. This table includes an Intel Alder Lake 12900HK with 45w base power and 115w peak featured in a Dell Alienware x17 r2 laptop.\n\n```\nRank   System/CPU                  (msec)  Threads   Tester       Compiler                 System/OS/Compile Line Reference/etc.\n\nRyzen 5950X 16-core  3.4-4.9GHz      1376     120     cr           gcc 11.2                 Ubuntu 21.11.

Presumably, this user compiled R with the [experimental gFortran](https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS/releases). This suggests R may soon provide robust support for this architecture. In the short term, R users should be aware of [R's expectations for NaN values](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2020/11/02/will-r-work-on-apple-silicon/). Until this situation is resolved, users should be wary of using R on this architecture.\n\n## SPM\n\n[SPM12](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/) is one of the dominant tools used for brain imaging. It uses Matlab along with compiled C code (mex files), both of which must currently be translated. In addition, the macOS is wary of the downloaded mex files, which look like malware. Therefore, users must [explicitly provide permission for these to be executed](https://transang.me/macos-open-file-from-unidentified-developers/) with a command like `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine *.mexmaci64`. To evaluate the performance of SPM, I installed the [Clinical Toolbox](https://github.com/neurolabusc/Clinical) and timed the processing of the included tutorial dataset (`tic; clinical_mrnorm('T1.nii','lesionT2.nii','T2.nii'); toc`). Lower values indicate faster performance. The open source [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/index) is available natively for the M1, and SPM can compile native mex files. However, in limited testing native Octave was slower than Matlab in translation.\n\n![spm](spm.png)\n\n## Surfice\n\n[Surfice](https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/surfice:MainPage) is a used for visualization of neuroimaging data supporting [mesh rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh). It is available for Linux, Windows and as a universal binary for MacOS (supporting both Intel and M1 CPUs). Unlike volume rendering, mesh rendering requires that the raw voxel data from MRI and CT scans is converted to a [mesh of triangles](http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonise/). Subsequently, we want to [adaptively simplify the mesh](http://www.alecjacobson.com/weblog/?p=4444), reducing the number of triangular faces while preserving curvature. For this task, Surfice provides a command for [fast quadric mesh simplification](https://github.com/sp4cerat/Fast-Quadric-Mesh-Simplification). To examine performance of different CPUs, we will apply a 95% reduction to a brain mesh. The figure below shows the original mesh (left column, 1486759 triangles) and the simplified mesh (right column, 74326 triangles). The upper row shows the rendered meshes - note how similar the meshes look. The lower row shows the triangles, illustrating the dramatic reduction in triangles. \n\n![mesh reduction](surfice.jpg)\n\nIn this implementation, mesh simplification is a single-threaded test of CPU performance. The M1 dominates this test.\n\n![surfice](surfice.png)\n\n## NaNs\n\nTools like SPM use the value [`Not a Number`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN) to signify data that should be ignored (e.g. voxels outside the brain). Any computation (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, etc) that includes a NaN will result in a NaN. Old timers will remember the launch of the [Pentium 4](https://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/SpmWithPentium4#c_nan_test) which had remarkable performance on paper, but exhibited poor performance with SPM. This was because the Pentium 4 floating point unit (FPU) had a huge penalty for any computation with a NaN. Users had to recompile their software to use the vectorized SSE instructions which did not exhibit this penalty. Testing of the [C and Matlab](https://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/SpmWithPentium4#c_nan_test) code suggests that the M1 does not exhibit a NaN penalty, and indeed can be faster for NaNs (since no real computation needs to be done).\n\n## Double-precision floating-point format and SIMD\n\nWhile 32-bit (FP32) computations are sufficient for most needs, some scientific tools demand double-precision floating-point format ([FP64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format)). Indeed, tools like Matlab use FP64 by default and are tuned for this datatype. FP64 has demands for speed, efficiency and bandwidth. It is common for consumer devices like video gaming graphics cards to devote fewer resources to [FP64](https://www.microway.com/knowledge-center-articles/comparison-of-nvidia-geforce-gpus-and-nvidia-tesla-gpus/) than graphics cards used for industrial compute applications. Given the M1's heritage as a processor for consumer mobile phones, one might wonder if the FP64 performance has been compromised.\n\nFloating-point performance was tested with a [simple C program](https://github.com/neurolabusc/simd) that compares classic scalar C code with code that explicitly uses vectorized SIMD (single instruction, multiple data). Note a smart compiler might be able to vectorize C code. In the graph below, the square-root is calculated independently for 808704000 voxels [emulating a resting state dataset](https://protocols.humanconnectome.org/HCP/3T/imaging-protocols.html). Conducting a single computation on a huge array is cache inefficient, but typical behavior for many neuroimaging tools. Therefore, on many platforms this test may be constrained by memory bandwidth rather than computational power.\n\nThe x86-64 architecture provides 128-bit SSE instructions (which can handle x4 32-bit computations or x2 64-bit computations at once), 256-bit AVX (x8, x4), and (untested) 512-bit AVX-512 (x16, x8). Note that using these power-hungry instructions can lead to a [reduction](https://blog.cloudflare.com/on-the-dangers-of-intels-frequency-scaling/) in clock [frequency](https://lemire.me/blog/2018/09/04/per-core-frequency-scaling-and-avx-512-an-experiment/). The Apple M1 includes 128-bit Neon instructions, but not the upcoming Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) instructions.\n\nThe graph shows milliseconds to compute square-root for 808704000 voxels, with lower values indicating faster performance. The blue, orange and green bars are performance for FP32 computations (scalar, 128-bit and 256-bit SIMD respectively), and the red, purple and brown show FP64. The i5-8259u appears constrained by the bandwidth of its lower power memory, as explicit vector instructions do not improve performance (the increasing time for the first three bars may reflect thermal throttling, as these were run sequentially). Obviously, all systems show a penalty for 64-bit versus 32-bit precision. The Ryzen 3900X has outstanding floating-point abilities, combined with high-performance (albeit power hungry) memory. The M1 shows no benefit from explicit use of Neon instructions, suggesting either the compiler implicitly uses them or this task is memory constrained. While the M1 is slower for double-precision (64-bit) versus single-precision (32-bit) computations, this is a stunning performance considering the 10w power envelope.\n\n![simd](simd.png)\n\nMatrix computations form the basis of many stages of neuroimaging processing and analysis. The command `sysctl -a | grep amx` reveals that the M1 supports [AMX version 2](https://nod.ai/comparing-apple-m1-with-amx2-m1-with-neon/) instructions which provides [512-bit double-precision and 1024-bit single-precision](https://gist.github.com/dougallj/7a75a3be1ec69ca550e7c36dc75e0d6f) SIMD computations. While not documented, these instructions can be accessed via the Accelerate framework including [vecLib](https://github.com/danielchalef/openblas-benchmark-m1), vImage, libBLAS, libBNNS, vDSP and LAPACK. The double-precision performance is particularly interesting, as Metal currently only supports single-precision. Since Apple uses the same function names (e.g. cblas_dgemm) as other Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) libraries available for Windows and Unix, one can exploit this new hardware by simpling compiling software linked to the Apple Accelerate framework.\n\nHowever, developers and users should be aware that not all Accelerate functions perform identically to their BLAS counterparts. NumPy 1.2.1 enables [Apple's Accelerate Framework](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/66d33faabf1f19d4b192c38e927dfa727b0ed61f/doc/source/release/1.21.0-notes.rst). However, [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/wiki/Dropping-support-for-Accelerate) dropped [support](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/7131) for Accelerate, despite supporting other non-open source BLAS libraries like Intel's MKL. Therefore, while Apple's Accelerate framework may yield excellent performance in simple benchmarks like those presented here, this may not predict typical performance of front line tools. Specifically, users with Intel/AMD CPUs can exploit the MKL with typical tools. In contrast, users of Apple's M1 may be limited to the openblas performance.\n\nApple also provides the GPU-based [Metal MPSMatrixMultiplication](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders/mpsmatrixmultiplication) function. However, this function has a series of [limitations](https://github.com/neurolabusc/Metal) that make it unsuitable for many neuroimaging applications. Fortunately, [AMX outperforms Metal](https://github.com/neurolabusc/Metal) for single precision, provides double precision support, and does not carry the crippling limitations.\n\nHere we conduct a simple test of matrix multiplication (source code main_mmul.cpp), using a dataset designed to mimic the permutation thresholding provided by [PALM](https://github.com/andersonwinkler/PALM/blob/900e47dfd8e782afed22197243cd57df4e43963a/palm_partition.m#L1) and [NiiStat](https://github.com/neurolabusc/NiiStat/blob/79e8821480c6d0976bd7f8076f52b473a110b573/nii_stat_core.m#L677). Specifically, we calculate the matrix multiplication `C[m][n] = A[m][p] * B[p][n]` where `m = 485776, n = 16, p = 120`. This simulates the main computation for a permutation thresholded general linear model analysis (specifically, a voxel-based morphometry analysis where 485776 voxels are in the brain, there are 120 participants and a model with one effect of interest and 15 nuisance regressors). Note that this computation will be conducted thousands of times.\n\nThe graph below shows time to complete this computation, with lower values illustrating better performance. The `32` and `64` labels show 32-bit single-precision and 64-bit double precision compuation. The `scalar` values use the [popular and intuitive C solution](https://github.com/afni/afni/blob/dab76581b2ddef36dd4d5974f122e9759732c5c5/src/matrix.c#L696) without [any](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel/class/cs5220-s10/slides/lec03.pdf) common [optimizations](http://apfel.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/~lehn/sghpc/gemm/). The `blas` value shows performance for the optimized `cblas_dgemm()` function (using [openblas](https://www.openblas.net)). The `accel` refers to Apple's Accelerate framework ([`cblas_dgemm()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/1513282-cblas_dgemm?language=objc) and [`vDSP_mmulD()`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/vdsp) perform identiclly). Ryzen values are also shown for the free but not open-source Intel [Math Kernel Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_Kernel_Library) (`MKL`) and [NVidia CUDA](https://solarianprogrammer.com/2012/05/31/matrix-multiplication-cuda-cublas-curand-thrust/) (`cuda`) libraries. The CUDA function uses the GTX 1080 Ti graphics card (see the cuda_mmul.cu source code). The timings for CUDA include the substantial memory transfer times between the CPU and GPU memory. Finally, the source code reports the maximum difference observed between the `scalar` and `blas` results, with negligible errors on the order of 1e-14 (one does not expect identical results, as optimized methods can use fused multiply-add operations that [reduce rounding errors](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15933100/how-to-use-fused-multiply-add-fma-instructions-with-sse-avx)). The poor scalar performance of the M1 relative to the Ryzen presumably reflects the large L3 cache of the Ryzen, which can be addressed through the optimzation tricks of the dedicated libraries. \n\n ![simd_mmul](simd_mmul.png)\n\nBeyond this floating point performance, the M1 shows impressive integer division performance that can be further accelerated using [SIMD](https://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/benchmarking-libdivide-m1-avx512.html).\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIt is remarkable that the M1 CPU in the MacBook Air has no fan, yet holds its own in these neuroimaging benchmarks. The promise of this architecture is hard to deny.\n\n## Software Evaluated\n\nHere is the status of a few tools I have evaluated. This selection is necessarily biased by my own tasks.\n\n - Native support\n   - [AFNI](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov)\n   - [dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix)\n   - [MRIcroGL](https://github.com/rordenlab/MRIcroGL12/releases)\n   - [MRIcron](https://github.com/neurolabusc/MRIcron/releases)\n   - [Surfice](https://github.com/neurolabusc/surf-ice/releases)\n - Translated Applications Appear to Function\n   - [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/)\n   - [Slicer](https://discourse.slicer.org/t/mac-m1-support/17545)\n   - [SPM12](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/)\n - Unsupported\n   - [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org) (solution: use version [prior to 5.6.1](https://discourse.paraview.org/t/paraview-on-new-macs-with-m1-chips/5909/9))\n   - [MRtrix mrview geometry shaders](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/issues/2247)\n\n## Late 2021 Update: M1 Pro and M1 Max\n\nIn late 2021 Apple released the M1 Pro and M1 Max. These include 6-8 performance CPUs, 2 efficiency CPUs, and 14-32 GPU cores, more RAM bandwidth, faster disks, and allow for more RAM. Similar to more extensive tests by [others](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17024/apple-m1-max-performance-review/5), the single-threaded performance is relatively unchanged, while multi-threaded operations can see a dramatic boost. These new computers seem targeted for Apple's core markets of photography, audio and video production. This page now includes details of from a base model M1 Pro (with 6 performance cores).\n\nSeveral core tools used in neuroimaging continue to run in translation, including FSL and Matlab 2021b. The GPU in the original M1 was already sufficient for visualization. The GPUs still do not support double precision calculations, and Apple does not support tools that aid in porting CUDA tools to Metal (e.g. AMDs GPUFORT). Therefore, neuroimaging tools can not harness the immense computational promise of the M1 Max GPU. If future hardware addresses these limitations, Apple Silicon would be well positioned for scientific applications.\n\nSeveral tests now also include data for the Ryzen AMD 5950X, which does show improved per-thread performance relative its predecessors.\n\n## Mid 2022 Update: M2\n\nIn the middle of 2022 Apple released the M2 CPU. While the M1 was based on the iPhone A14 CPU, the M2 is based on the A15. Reviews of the [A15 suggest little improvement for the performance cores, substantial improvement for the efficiency cores, and dramatic improvement for the GPU](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16983/the-apple-a15-soc-performance-review-faster-more-efficient/2). For neuroimaging, the main benefit if the increase of bandwidth from 68GB/s to 100GB/s, and improved multithreading performance. Note that the M1 Pro and Max already have more bandwidth and have a higher ratio of performance to efficiency cores. Therefore, while the M2 is a meaningful improvement over the original M1, it does not threaten the larger M1s. The M2 does not support Scalable Vector Extensions (SVE) and its GPU still does not support double precision.\n\n## Links\n\nThe motivation for this page was to evaluate the M1 with the tools and datasets popular for neuroimaging. The pages linked below test the M1 for other tasks, including synthetic benchmarks. Experts like Francois Piednoel have raised concerns that some of the older synthetic benchmarks are unrealistic for modern tasks, and are biased by the large L1 cache found in the M1.\n\n - [AnandTech](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested) provides a deep dive into the workings of the new M1 chip and its performance.\n - [Arstechnica](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/hands-on-with-the-apple-m1-a-seriously-fast-x86-competitor/) reviews M1 performance.\n - [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2020/11/21/apple-macbook-pro-13-m1-reviewwhy-you-might-want-to-pass/?sh=1542cd81786a) provides a more tempered review, noting issues that early adopters may face.\n - [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=apple-mac-m1&num=1) explores native and translated M1 performance on many benchmarks.\n - [PugetSystems](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/Apple-M1-MacBook-vs-PC-Desktop-Workstation-for-Adobe-Creative-Cloud-1975/) examines M1 laptops versus x86-64 workstations.

You\nneed one certificate per Pass Type ID.\n\nAfter adding this certificate to your Keychain, you need to export it as a\n`.p12` file first (go to Keychain Access, My Certificates and right-click to export), then convert that file into a `.pem` file using the `passkit-keys` command:\n\n```sh\n./bin/passkit-keys ./pathToKeysFolder\n```\nor openssl\n```sh\nopenssl pkcs12 -in <exported_cert_and_private_key>.p12 -clcerts -out com.example.passbook.pem -passin pass:<private_key_password>\n```\n\nand copy it into the keys directory.\n\nThe [Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification\nAuthority](https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/) certificate is not needed anymore since it is already included in this package.\n\n# Start with a template\n\nStart with a template. A template has all the common data fields that will be\nshared between your passes.\n\n```js\nconst { Template } = require(\"@walletpass/pass-js\");\n\n// Create a Template from local folder, see __test__/resources/passes for examples\n// .load will load all fields from pass.json,\n// as well as all images and com.example.passbook.pem file as key\n// and localization string too\nconst template = await Template.load(\n  \"./path/to/templateFolder\",\n  \"secretKeyPasswod\"\n);\n\n// or\n// create a Template from a Buffer with ZIP content\nconst s3 = new AWS.S3({ apiVersion: \"2006-03-01\", region: \"us-west-2\" });\nconst s3file = await s3\n  .getObject({\n    Bucket: \"bucket\",\n    Key: \"pass-template.zip\"\n  })\n  .promise();\nconst template = await Template.fromBuffer(s3file.Body);\n\n// or create it manually\nconst template = new Template(\"coupon\", {\n  passTypeIdentifier: \"pass.com.example.passbook\",\n  teamIdentifier: \"MXL\",\n  backgroundColor: \"red\",\n  sharingProhibited: true\n});\nawait template.images.add(\"icon\", iconPngFileBuffer)\n                     .add(\"logo\", pathToLogoPNGfile)\n```\n\nThe first argument is the pass style (`coupon`, `eventTicket`, etc), and the\nsecond optional argument has any fields you want to set on the template.\n\nYou can access template fields directly, or from chained accessor methods, e.g:\n\n```js\ntemplate.passTypeIdentifier = \"pass.com.example.passbook\";\ntemplate.teamIdentifier = \"MXL\";\n```\n\nThe following template fields are required:\n\n- `passTypeIdentifier` - The Apple Pass Type ID, which has the prefix `pass.`\n- `teamIdentifier` - May contain an I\n\nYou can set any available fields either on a template or pass instance, such as: `backgroundColor`,\n`foregroundColor`, `labelColor`, `logoText`, `organizationName`,\n`suppressStripShine` and `webServiceURL`.\n\nIn addition, you need to tell the template where to find the key file:\n\n```js\nawait template.loadCertificate(\n  \"/etc/passbook/certificate_and_key.pem\",\n  \"secret\"\n);\n// or set them as strings\ntemplate.setCertificate(pemEncodedPassCertificate);\ntemplate.setPrivateKey(pemEncodedPrivateKey, optionalKeyPassword);\n```\n\nIf you have images that are common to all passes, you may want to specify them once in the template:\n\n```js\n// specify a single image with specific density and localization\nawait pass.images.add(\"icon\", iconFilename, \"2x\", \"ru\");\n// load all appropriate images in all densities and localizations\nawait template.images.load(\"./images\");\n```\n\nYou can add the image itself or a `Buffer`. Image format is enforced to be **PNG**.\n\nAlternatively, if you have one directory containing the template file `pass.json`, the key\n`com.example.passbook.pem` and all the needed images, you can just use this single command:\n\n```js\nconst template = await Template.load(\n  \"./path/to/templateFolder\",\n  \"secretKeyPasswod\"\n);\n```\n\nYou can use the options parameter of the template factory functions to set the `allowHttp` property. This enables you to use a `webServiceUrl` in your `pass.json` that uses the HTTP protocol instead of HTTPS for development purposes:\n\n```js\nconst template = await Template.load(\n  \"./path/to/templateFolder\",\n  \"secretKeyPasswod\",\n  {\n    allowHttp: true,\n  },\n);\n```\n\n# Create your pass\n\nTo create a new pass from a template:\n\n```js\nconst pass = template.createPass({\n  serialNumber: \"123456\",\n  description: \"20% off\"\n});\n```\n\nJust like the template, you can access pass fields directly, e.g:\n\n```js\npass.serialNumber = \"12345\";\npass.description = \"20% off\";\n```\n\nIn the JSON specification, structure fields (primary fields, secondary fields,\netc) are represented as arrays, but items must have distinct key properties. Le\nsigh.\n\nTo make it easier, you can use methods of standard Map object or `add` that\nwill do the logical thing. For example, to add a primary field:\n\n```js\npass.primaryFields.add({ key: \"time\", label: \"Time\", value: \"10:00AM\" });\n```\n\nTo get one or all fields:\n\n```js\nconst dateField = pass.primaryFields.get(\"date\");\nfor (const [key, { value }] of pass.primaryFields.entries()) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nTo remove one or all fields:\n\n```js\npass.primaryFields.delete(\"date\");\npass.primaryFields.clear();\n```\n\nAdding images to a pass is the same as adding images to a template (see above).\n\n# Working with Dates\nIf you have [dates in your fields](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Reference/PassKit_Bundle/Chapters/FieldDictionary.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012026-CH4-SW6) make sure they are in ISO 8601 format with timezone or a `Date` instance. \n For example:\n\n```js\nconst { constants } = require('@walletpass/pass-js');\n\npass.primaryFields.add({ key: \"updated\", label: \"Updated at\", value: new Date(), dateStyle: constants.dateTimeFormat.SHORT, timeStyle: constants.dateTimeFormat.SHORT });\n\n// there is also a helper setDateTime method\npass.auxiliaryFields.setDateTime(\n  'serviceDate',\n  'DATE',\n  serviceMoment.toDate(),\n  {\n    dateStyle: constants.dateTimeFormat.MEDIUM,\n    timeStyle: constants.dateTimeFormat.NONE,\n    changeMessage: 'Service date changed to %@.',\n  },\n);\n// main fields also accept Date objects\npass.relevantDate = new Date(2020, 1, 1, 10, 0);\ntemplate.expirationDate = new Date(2020, 10, 10, 10, 10);\n```\n\n# Localizations\n\nThis library fully supports both [string localization](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/PassKit_PG/Creating.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012195-CH4-SW54) and/or [images localization](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/PassKit_PG/Creating.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012195-CH4-SW1):\n\n```js\n// everything from template\n// will load all localized images and strings from folders like ru.lproj/ or fr-CA.lproj/\nawait template.load(folderPath);\n\n// Strings\n\npass.localization\n  .add(\"en-GB\", {\n    GATE: \"GATE\",\n    DEPART: \"DEPART\",\n    ARRIVE: \"ARRIVE\",\n    SEAT: \"SEAT\",\n    PASSENGER: \"PASSENGER\",\n    FLIGHT: \"FLIGHT\"\n  })\n  .add(\"ru\", {\n    GATE: \"\u0412\u042b\u0425\u041e\u0414\",\n    DEPART: \"\u0412\u042b\u041b\u0415\u0422\",\n    ARRIVE: \"\u041f\u0420\u0418\u041b\u0401\u0422\",\n    SEAT: \"\u041c\u0415\u0421\u0422\u041e\",\n    PASSENGER: \"\u041f\u0410\u0421\u0421\u0410\u0416\u0418\u0420\",\n    FLIGHT: \"\u0420\u0415\u0419\u0421\"\n  });\n\n// Images\n\nawait template.images.add(\n  \"logo\" | \"icon\" | etc,\n  imageFilePathOrBufferWithPNGdata,\n  \"1x\" | \"2x\" | \"3x\" | undefined,\n  \"ru\"\n);\n```\n\nLocalization applies for all fields' `label` and `value`. There is a note about that in [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/PassKit_PG/Creating.html).\n\n# Generate the file\n\nTo generate a file:\n\n```js\nconst buf = await pass.asBuffer();\nawait fs.writeFile(\"pathToPass.pkpass\", buf);\n```\n\nYou can send the buffer directly to an HTTP server response:\n\n```js\napp.use(async (ctx, next) => {\n  ctx.status = 200;\n  ctx.type = passkit.constants.PASS_MIME_TYPE;\n  ctx.body = await pass.asBuffer();\n});\n```\n\n# Troubleshooting with Console app\n\nIf the pass file generates without errors but you aren't able to open your pass on an iPhone, plug the iPhone into a Mac with macOS 10.14+ and open the 'Console' application. On the left, you can select your iPhone. You will then be able to inspect any errors that occur while adding the pass.\n\n## Stay in touch\n\n* Author - [Konstantin Vyatkin](https://github.com/tinovyatkin)\n* Email - tino [at] vtkn.io\n\n## License\n\n`@walletpass/pass-js` is [MIT licensed](LICENSE).\n\n# Financial Contributors\n\nBecome a financial contributor and help us sustain our community.

It is possible because a digital image can be interpreted as different frequencies represented as sine waves.\n\n> High frequencies in an image will contain information about fine details, such as skin pores, hair, fine lines, skin imperfections.\n\n> Low frequencies are the image data that contains information about volume, tone and color transitions. In other words: shadows and light areas, colors and tones.\n\n> https://fstoppers.com/post-production/ultimate-guide-frequency-separation-technique-8699\n\nBy using [High Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pass_filter) filter, the image can be separated into high and low spatial frequencies. Then we will be able to smoothing the image while preseving a fine level of detail by applying adjustments (`Curve Adjustment` in the diagram) to certain frequencies of the image.\n\n#### High Pass Filter\n\nThere's no `High Pass` filter in CoreImage. Luckily it's not hard to create one (`High Pass Filter` section in the diagram):\n\n```\nhighpass.rgb = image.rgb - gaussianBlurredImage.rgb + vec3(0.5,0.5,0.5)\n```\n\n#### Mask Generating\n\nA mask image is generated using high pass filter (Green and blue channel overlay blend -> high pass -> hard light blend X 3) for separating the parts of the image which need to be adjusted from the ones that should remain untouched.\n\nThis mask image is then used in `Blend with Mask (CIBlendWithMask)` filter to blend the adjusted image with the untouched one to produce the final output image.\n\n##### Improvements\n\nBesides the steps in the diagram, `YUCIHighPassSkinSmoothing` actually has two more steps.\n\nThe exposure of the input image is decreased by 1 EV before being sent to the `Mask Generating Routine` (in `-[YUCIHighPassSkinSmoothingMaskGenerator outputImage]` method) and a RGB curve adjustment is added to the mask at the end of the `Mask Generating Routine` (at the end of `YUCIHighPassSkinSmoothingMaskBoost.cikernel`).\n\nThese steps can make the result better on the areas with high brightness. The whole process can of course work without these two steps.\n\n#### Input Parameters\n\n`inputAmount`: A number value that controls the intensity of the `Curve Adjustment` step and affects the sharpness of the final `Sharpen` step. You use this value to control the overall filter strength. Valid from `0` to `1.0`. The default value is `0.75`.\n\n`inputToneCurveControlPoints`: A array of `CIVector` that defines the control points of the curve in `Curve Adjustment` step. The default value of this parameter is `[(0,0), (120/255.0,146/255.0), (1,1)]`.\n\n`inputRadius`: A number value that controls the radius (in pixel) of the `High Pass` filter. The default value of this parameter is `8.0`. Try adjusting this value according to the resolution of the input image and the level of detail you want to preserve.\n\n`inputSharpnessFactor`: A number value that controls the sharpness factor of the final `Sharpen` step. The sharpness value is calculated as `inputAmount * inputSharpnessFactor`. The default value for this parameter is `0.6`. __Note:__ Sharpen is an expensive operation (it involves convolution). The final `Sharpen` step will make the output image look better, however it is not necessary. Consider setting this parameter to `0` when you need to get the best performance.\n\n## Consideration\n\nFor the best result, you need to create the `CIContext` object with a sRGB working color space instead of the default light-linear color space. You can specify a working color space when creating a context using the `kCIContextWorkingColorSpace` key in the `options` dictionary.\n\nYou can also try to apply this filter only to the skin/face area of a image, by using a skin detection filter or the core image face detector.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* iOS 8.0+ / OS X 10.11+\n* Xcode 7.0+\n\n## Usage\n\nUse the `YUCIHighPassSkinSmoothing`, like any other built in core image filters.\n\nDocumentation for the input parameters can be found [here](#input-parameters).\n\n```swift\nlet filter = YUCIHighPassSkinSmoothing()\nfilter.inputImage = ...\nfilter.inputAmount = ...\nlet outputImage = filter.outputImage!\n\n/* Or */\n\nlet filter = CIFilter(name: \"YUCIHighPassSkinSmoothing\")!\nfilter.setValue(inputImage, forKey: kCIInputImageKey)\nfilter.setValue(0.7, forKey: \"inputAmount\")\nlet outputImage = filter.outputImage!\n```\n\nOpen `YUCIHighPassSkinSmoothingDemo/YUCIHighPassSkinSmoothingDemo.xcworkspace` to run the iOS demo app. The demo app demonstrated how to use the filter and how to use different kinds of core image context to render the output image.

Runs fast on Intel / AMD / Nvidia / Apple-Silicon with Vulkan API.\n\nwaifu2x-ncnn-vulkan uses [ncnn project](https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn) as the universal neural network inference framework.\n\n## [Download](https://github.com/nihui/waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan/releases)\n\nDownload Windows/Linux/MacOS Executable for Intel/AMD/Nvidia GPU\n\n**https://github.com/nihui/waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan/releases**\n\nThis package includes all the binaries and models required. It is portable, so no CUDA or Caffe runtime environment is needed :)\n\n## Usages\n\n### Example Command\n\n```shell\nwaifu2x-ncnn-vulkan.exe -i input.jpg -o output.png -n 2 -s 2\n```\n\n### Full Usages\n\n```console\nUsage: waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan -i infile -o outfile [options]...\n\n  -h                   show this help\n  -v                   verbose output\n  -i input-path        input image path (jpg/png/webp) or directory\n  -o output-path       output image path (jpg/png/webp) or directory\n  -n noise-level       denoise level (-1/0/1/2/3, default=0)\n  -s scale             upscale ratio (1/2/4/8/16/32, default=2)\n  -t tile-size         tile size (>=32/0=auto, default=0) can be 0,0,0 for multi-gpu\n  -m model-path        waifu2x model path (default=models-cunet)\n  -g gpu-id            gpu device to use (-1=cpu, default=auto) can be 0,1,2 for multi-gpu\n  -j load:proc:save    thread count for load/proc/save (default=1:2:2) can be 1:2,2,2:2 for multi-gpu\n  -x                   enable tta mode\n  -f format            output image format (jpg/png/webp, default=ext/png)\n```\n\n- `input-path` and `output-path` accept either file path or directory path\n- `noise-level` = noise level, large value means strong denoise effect, -1 = no effect\n- `scale` = scale level, 1 = no scaling, 2 = upscale 2x\n- `tile-size` = tile size, use smaller value to reduce GPU memory usage, default selects automatically\n- `load:proc:save` = thread count for the three stages (image decoding + waifu2x upscaling + image encoding), using larger values may increase GPU usage and consume more GPU memory. You can tune this configuration with \"4:4:4\" for many small-size images, and \"2:2:2\" for large-size images. The default setting usually works fine for most situations. If you find that your GPU is hungry, try increasing thread count to achieve faster processing.\n- `format` = the format of the image to be output, png is better supported, however webp generally yields smaller file sizes, both are losslessly encoded\n\nIf you encounter a crash or error, try upgrading your GPU driver:\n\n- Intel: https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers\n- AMD: https://www.amd.com/en/support\n- NVIDIA: https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx\n\n## Build from Source\n\n1. Download and setup the Vulkan SDK from https://vulkan.lunarg.com/\n  - For Linux distributions, you can either get the essential build requirements from package manager\n```shell\ndnf install vulkan-headers vulkan-loader-devel\n```\n```shell\napt-get install libvulkan-dev\n```\n```shell\npacman -S vulkan-headers vulkan-icd-loader\n```\n\n2. Clone this project with all submodules\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/nihui/waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan.git\ncd waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n```\n\n3.

If you lose data, your computer melts, your house blows up or your current planet of residents is destroyed I take no responsibility. Basically don't blame me if anything goes wrong :)\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS:-\r\n\r\n1. Download the ATVBrowser zip file.\r\n\r\n2. Windows:- Unzip the package to any location you like, just keep the directory structure intact.\r\n   Mac:-     Unzip the package to your Home folder, keep the directory structure intact.\r\n   \r\n3. You need two pieces of information, the IP address of the computer your running the DNS Proxy and Web server on and the DNS address of your ISP.\r\n\r\n4. Open up the following file /ATVBrowser/atv.js and change the IP address on the second line to the IP address of your computer.\r\n\r\n5. Open up the following file /ATVBrowser/utils.js and change the IP address on the second line to the IP address of your ISP's DNS.\r\n\r\n6. You will need any m4v video file that will play on the ATV, it can be a iTunes store purchased file with DRM if you like.\r\n\r\n7. Rename the video file to test.m4v and copy it into the /ATBrowser/assets directory.\r\n\r\nNow we need to install Node.js\r\n\r\n1. Goto www.nodejs.org/download\r\n\r\n2. Windows:- Download and run the Windows Installer(.msi). VERY IMPORTANT!!! You need the full Windows installer and you need to reboot your computer for your PATH variable to be updated.\r\n   Mac:-     Download and install the Mac OSX Installer(.pkg) Universal package. VERY IMPORTANT!!! You need the full installer and not just the binaries.\r\n   \r\nRunning it all\r\n\r\nWindows:-\r\n1. Open a command prompt and cd into the ATVBrowser directory.\r\n2. Type:- node atv.js then press enter.\r\n3. If all goes well you'll get a message saying the DNS Proxy and Web server are running.\r\n\r\nMac:-\r\n1. Open Terminal. The terminal should start up in your home directory.\r\n2. Type:- cd ATVBrowser followed by enter.\r\n3. Type:- sudo node atv.js followed by enter. You'll need to enter your user password. VERY IMPORTANT!!! You need to use sudo.\r\n4. If all goes well you'll get a message saying the DNS Proxy and Web server are running.\r\n\r\nNow goto Setting/General/Network on your ATV and change the DNS address to the IP address of your computer, the one you entered into atv.js.\r\nBrowse over to the Trailer app on the ATV and have fun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n******* Updated Instructions for installing node.js on Windows *******\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

There are 3 things\nrequired:\n\n* Verify your domain by putting a file you can obtain from Apple named\n  `apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association` in `./demo/well-known` folder.\n* Put your merchant identity certificate to `./certs` directory with a name\n  `apple-pay-cert.pem` at project's root.\n* Modify `./demo.js` and replace params with your own configuration:\n  `APPLE_PAY_CERTIFICATE_PATH`, `MERCHANT_IDENTIFIER`, `MERCHANT_DOMAIN`,\n  `MERCHANT_DISPLAY_NAME`\n\nOne the set up is done, run the server:\n\n```\nnpm run serve\n```\n\n## How to use\n`./dist/appr.js` will be the code to import.

You can handle\n[Apple Pay JS](https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs) by adding a\npayment method specifying \"`https://apple.com/apple-pay`\" as following example:\n\n```js\nlet method = [{\n \u00a0supportedMethods: ['https://apple.com/apple-pay'],\n \u00a0data: {\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0supportedNetworks: [\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'amex', 'discover', 'masterCard', 'visa'\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0],\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0countryCode: 'US',\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0validationEndpoint: '/applepay/validate/',\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0merchantIdentifier: 'merchant.com.agektmr.payment'\n \u00a0}\n}];\n\nlet details = {\n  displayItems: [{\n    label: 'Original donation amount',\n    amount: { currency: 'USD', value: '0.01' }\n  }],\n  shippingOptions: [{\n    id: 'standard',\n    label: 'Standard shipping',\n    amount: { currency: 'USD', value: '0.01' }\n  }, {\n    id: 'express',\n    label: 'Express shipping',\n    amount: { currency: 'USD', value: '0.99' }\n  }],\n  total: {\n    label: 'Total due',\n    amount: { currency: 'USD', value : '0.01' }\n  }\n};\n\nlet options = {\n  requestShipping: true,\n  requestPayerEmail: true,\n  requestPayerPhone: true,\n  requestPayerName: true,\n  shippingType: 'shipping'\n};\n\nlet request = new PaymentRequest(methods, details, options);\nlet response;\n\nrequest.addEventListener('shippingaddresschange', e => {\n  e.updateWith(new Promise(resolve => {\n    let result;\n    let addr = request.shippingAddress;\n    let price = new priceCalc(details);\n    if (addr.country.toUpperCase() === 'US') {\n      result = price.selectShippingOption('standard');\n    } else if (addr.country.toUpperCase() === 'JP') {\n      result = price.selectShippingOption('express');\n    } else {\n      details.shippingOptions = [];\n      resolve(details);\n      return;\n    }\n    resolve(result);\n  }));\n});\n\nrequest.addEventListener('shippingoptionchange', e => {\n  e.updateWith(new Promise(resolve => {\n    let calc = new priceCalc(details);\n    let result = calc.selectShippingOption(request.shippingOption);\n    resolve(result);\n  }));\n});\n\nrequest.show().then(result => {\n  if (response.methodName === 'https://apple.com/apple-pay') {\n    // Apple Pay JS case\n    // Do whatever you need to do with the token:\n    // `response.applePayRaw`\n  } else {\n    // Everything else will be pure Payment Request API response\n  }\n}).then(response => {\n  response.complete('success');\n}).catch(e => {\n  if (e) {\n    alert(`Could not make payment: ${e}`);\n  }\n  if (response) {\n    response.complete('fail');\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Payment method properties\nThe first argument to the `PaymentRequest` constructor.\n\n* [`supportedNetworks`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs/paymentrequest/1916122-supportednetworks) is required.\n* `data`:\n    * [`countryCode`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs/paymentrequest/1916117-countrycode) is required.\n    * [`billingContact`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs/paymentrequest/1916125-billingcontact) is optional.\n    * [`shippingContact`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs/paymentrequest/1916127-shippingcontact) is optional. It allows you to provide default shipping contact information in Apple Pay JS.\n    * [`merchantCapabilities`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs/paymentrequest/1916123-merchantcapabilities) defaults to ['supports3DS'] unless you provide any.\n    * `validationEndpoint` is optional. Specify the merchant validation endpoint on your server. If you omit this, handle validatemerchant event yourself.\n    * `merchantIdentifier` is required. Specify your merchant id.\n\nWith `validationEndpoint`, appr-wrapper automatically handles `validatemerchant`\nevent for you. On your server's specified endpoint, you'll receive a `POST`\nrequest with `validationURL`, so you can validate yourself and respond with a\nmerchant session object returned following [these\ninstructions](https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs/applepaysession/1778021-onvalidatemerchant).\nYou can optionally handle the `validatemerchant` event by yourself by adding an\nevent handler.\n\n```js\nlet method = [{\n \u00a0supportedMethods: ['https://apple.com/apple-pay'],\n \u00a0data: {\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0supportedNetworks: [\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'amex', 'discover', 'masterCard', 'visa'\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0],\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0countryCode: 'US',\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0validationEndpoint: '/applepay/validate/',\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0merchantIdentifier: 'merchant.com.agektmr.payment'\n \u00a0}\n}];\n```\n\n### Payment details properties\nThe second argument to the `PaymentRequest` constructor.\n\n* The `total.amount.currency` is converted to\n  [currencyCode](https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs/paymentrequest/1916118-currencycode)\n  in Apple Pay JS.\n\n```js\nlet details = {\n  displayItems: [{\n    label: 'Original donation amount',\n    amount: { currency: 'USD', value: '0.01' }\n  }],\n  shippingOptions: [{\n    id: 'standard',\n    label: 'Standard shipping',\n    amount: { currency: 'USD', value: '0.01' }\n  }, {\n    id: 'express',\n    label: 'Express shipping',\n    amount: { currency: 'USD', value: '0.99' }\n  }],\n  total: {\n    label: 'Total due',\n    amount: { currency: 'USD', value : '0.01' }\n  }\n};\n```\n\nLet's look into what each parameters convert to, one by one.\n\n### Payment options properties\nThe third argument to the `PaymentRequest` constructor.\n* `requestPayerEmail`, `requestPayerPhone`, `requestPayerName` are respectively\n  converted to\n  [`requireBillingContactFields`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs/paymentrequest/2216120-requiredbillingcontactfields)\n  and\n  [`requireShippingContactFields`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs/paymentrequest/2216121-requiredshippingcontactfields)\n  values in Apple Pay JS.\n* `pickup` in `shippingType` will be converted to `servicePickup` in Apple Pay\n  JS. Others are handled as they are.\n\n```js\nlet options = {\n  requestShipping: true,\n  requestPayerEmail: true,\n  requestPayerPhone: true,\n  requestPayerName: true,\n  shippingType: 'shipping'\n};\n```\n\n### canMakePayment()\n`canMakePayment()` will invoke `canMakePaymentsWithActiveCard()` in Apple Pay JS.\n\n```js\nrequest.canMakePayment().then(result => {\n  if (result) {\n    return request.show();\n  } else {\n    // fallback to checkout form or start setting up ApplePayJS\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Shipping contact selected event / shipping method selected event\nYou can handle\n* [`shippingcontactselected`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs/applepayshippingcontactselectedevent)\n  event in Apple Pay JS as `shippingaddresschange` event in Payment Request.\n* [`shippingmethodselected`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs/applepayshippingmethodselectedevent)\n  event in Apple Pay JS as `shippingoptionchange` event in Payment Request.\n\n```js\nrequest.addEventListener('shippingaddresschange', e => {\n  e.updateWith(new Promise(resolve => {\n    let result;\n    let addr = request.shippingAddress;\n    let price = new priceCalc(details);\n    if (addr.country.toUpperCase() === 'US') {\n      result = price.selectShippingOption('standard');\n    } else if (addr.country.toUpperCase() === 'JP') {\n      result = price.selectShippingOption('express');\n    } else {\n      details.shippingOptions = [];\n      resolve(details);\n      return;\n    }\n    resolve(result);\n  }));\n});\n\nrequest.addEventListener('shippingoptionchange', e => {\n  e.updateWith(new Promise(resolve => {\n    let calc = new priceCalc(details);\n    let result = calc.selectShippingOption(request.shippingOption);\n    resolve(result);\n  }));\n});\n```\n\n### Handling payment response\nOnce `show()` resolves, you will recive an object which is slightly different\nfrom actual `PaymentResponse` object. Equivalent to this resolution is\n[`paymentauthorized`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs/applepaypaymentauthorizedevent)\nevent where you will receive an event object that contains an\n[`ApplePayPayment`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/applepayjs/applepaypayment)\nobject in Apple Pay JS.\n\nTo determine if the response is for Apple Pay JS, you can examine `methodName`\nproperty of the payment response. If it is \"`https://apple.com/apple-pay`\", this\nis Apple Pay JS. The payment response object is constructed to replicate\n`PaymentResponse` as much as possible, but it's not perfect due to technical\nrestrictions. If you prefer using actual payment response from Apple Pay JS API,\ntry `applePayRaw` property which holds actual `ApplePayPayment` object.\n\n```js\nrequest.show().then(result => {\n  // process payment\n  response = result;\n  if (response.methodName === 'https://apple.com/apple-pay') {\n    // Apple Pay JS case\n    // Do whatever you need to do with the token:\n    // `response.applePayRaw`\n  } else {\n    // Everything else will be pure Payment Request API response\n  }\n}).then(response => {\n  response.complete('success');\n}).catch(e => {\n  if (e) {\n    alert(`Could not make payment: ${e}`);\n  }\n  if (response) {\n    response.complete('fail');\n  }\n});\n```\n"

Those specificities are:\n* Apple sends the Authentication Response as a POST request if scopes were requested;\n* User data (email, first name and last name) is received in the body of the authentication response\u2014there is no Userinfo endpoint;\n* User data is provided only the first time the user authorizes the client on his Apple account;\n* The Token Request must be authentified by a JWT token signed by a specific private key.\n\nThe present extension addresses all these requirements.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Download the latest release of the provider JAR file [here](https://github.com/BenjaminFavre/keycloak-apple-social-identity-provider/releases).\n1. Install the provider JAR file following Keycloak instructions [there](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development/index.html#using-the-keycloak-deployer).\n\n## Configuration\n\nIn Keycloak admin console:\n1. Add an identity provider and select *Apple*.\n1. Fill *Client secret* with the base 64 content of your private key file (trim delimiters and new lines).\n\n   e.g., if your private key is:\n   \n       -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n       Rp6vMlHPYTHnyucsPvFk8gTzdYtTueMbmVznAtkUKhD9HPcI3bLKDrr0b2mNJLfS\n       tsyvhbpyMUIpaffKQcY7IUuM20ecYBjiyjkLuX5eDQUInWUINfCCyXQnNdSU4K1j\n       2z4IJrvacQz1PFrL0Tj4lt72jSxikzMBHWsGdFyT90bx0R26GR4YCudKxltozVrK\n       PsUC1cdy\n       -----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n   \n   then you should set *Client secret* with:\n   \n       Rp6vMlHPYTHnyucsPvFk8gTzdYtTueMbmVznAtkUKhD9HPcI3bLKDrr0b2mNJLfStsyvhbpyMUIpaffKQcY7IUuM20ecYBjiyjkLuX5eDQUInWUINfCCyXQnNdSU4K1j2z4IJrvacQz1PFrL0Tj4lt72jSxikzMBHWsGdFyT90bx0R26GR4YCudKxltozVrKPsUC1cdy\n\n1.

your Linux distro; then try switching between the built-in\naudio profiles and see if it's receiving the background sound with help of the\n`pavucontrol` command, it should work on 'Analog Stereo Duplex' built-in audio\nprofile.\n\nWith the MacBookPro14,1 the internal audio output is working, however the\ninternal audio input is not working.\n\nFor the rest of the MacBook Pro models the audio

That's useful\nif you want to use a different fan speed profile than the hardware uses by\ndefault. In that case, you might want to use a tool like\n[`mbpfan`](https://github.com/dgraziotin/mbpfan).\n\nThe ambient light sensor is working out of the box for the models without Touch\nBar, using the `applesmc` module as well. In models with Touch Bar, the ambient\nlight sensor isn't connected to the traditional SMC, but to the iBridge\ninstead.

It's the interface to the\nembedded T1-chip running iOS and providing access to the ambient light sensor,\nthe FaceTime HD camera, the Touch Bar and Touch ID.\n\nA prerequisite for all devices connected to the iBridge to work is a\nfirmware stored by macOS on the EFI system partition (ESP). For the time being\nthe easiest way to keep this firmware available is to install Linux in\naddition to macOS and keeping the contents of the original ESP in place.\n\nIf the iBridge couldn't be initialized (e.g. because the firmware is\nmissing), instead of the usual USB device, the following USB device is\npresent: `Apple Mobile Device [Recovery Mode]` (`Bus 001 Device 003: ID\n05ac:1281 Apple, Inc.`)\n\n`usb-devices` shows that *iBridge* exposes four interfaces:\n\n```\nT:  Bus=01 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=02 Cnt=01 Dev#=  2 Spd=480 MxCh= 0\nD:  Ver= 2.00 Cls=ef(misc ) Sub=02 Prot=01 MxPS=64 #Cfgs=  3\nP:  Vendor=05ac ProdID=8600 Rev=01.01\nS:  Manufacturer=Apple Inc.\nS:  Product=iBridge\nC:  #Ifs= 4 Cfg#= 1 Atr=e0 MxPwr=0mA\nI:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 0 Cls=0e(video) Sub=01 Prot=00 Driver=uvcvideo\nI:  If#= 1 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=0e(video) Sub=02 Prot=00 Driver=uvcvideo\nI:  If#= 2 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=03(HID  ) Sub=01 Prot=01 Driver=usbhid\nI:  If#= 3 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=03(HID  ) Sub=00 Prot=01 Driver=usbhid\n```\n\nThe two `video` interfaces could be the FaceTime HD camera and the Touch Bar,\nwhile the two `HID` interfaces could be the Touch Bar and the Touch ID button.\n\nBooting macOS as a VM interestingly leads to the following changed output of\n`usb-devices`:\n\n```\nT:  Bus=01 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=02 Cnt=01 Dev#=  2 Spd=480 MxCh= 0\nD:  Ver= 2.00 Cls=ef(misc ) Sub=02 Prot=01 MxPS=64 #Cfgs=  3\nP:  Vendor=05ac ProdID=8600 Rev=01.01\nS:  Manufacturer=Apple Inc.\nS:  Product=iBridge\nC:  #Ifs= 8 Cfg#= 2 Atr=e0 MxPwr=0mA\nI:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 0 Cls=0e(video) Sub=01 Prot=00 Driver=usbfs\nI:  If#= 1 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=0e(video) Sub=02 Prot=00 Driver=usbfs\nI:  If#= 2 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=03(HID  ) Sub=00 Prot=01 Driver=usbfs\nI:  If#= 3 Alt= 0 #EPs= 2 Cls=10() Sub=00 Prot=00 Driver=usbfs\nI:  If#= 4 Alt= 0 #EPs= 0 Cls=02(commc) Sub=0d Prot=00 Driver=usbfs\nI:  If#= 5 Alt= 1 #EPs= 2 Cls=0a(data ) Sub=00 Prot=01 Driver=usbfs\nI:  If#= 6 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=03(HID  ) Sub=00 Prot=01 Driver=usbfs\nI:  If#= 7 Alt= 0 #EPs= 2 Cls=ff(vend.) Sub=f9 Prot=11 Driver=usbfs\n```\n\nmacOS somehow initializes some additional capabilities of the *iBridge*.\nThose additional interfaces are likely responsible for Touch Id and the\nadvanced graphical functionality of the Touch Bar. There might also be some\nkind of interface for *iBridge*-firmware updates.\n\n### Disable auto-boot\n\nApple introduced an \"auto-boot\" feature with the MacBook Pro 2016 causing the\nnotebook to be switched on, whenever the screen lid is opened. By modifying a\nNVRAM variable this can be (luckily) disabled again.\n\nHow to do that from macOS as well as enabling the startup chime again is\ndocumented e.g. at\nhttp://www.idownloadblog.com/2016/10/31/how-to-stop-the-new-macbook-pro-from-automatically-turning-on-when-the-lid-is-open/\n\nTo disable auto boot from within Linux, ensure that `efivarfs` is mounted and\nrun:\n\n```\nprintf \"\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\" > /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/AutoBoot-7c436110-ab2a-4bbb-a880-fe41995c9f82\n```\n\nIf you get \"No space left on device\" errors, it's probably because of\n`dump-type0-*`-variables written by the Linux kernel taking up all space.\nRemoving them solves the problem:\n\n```\nfor i in $(find /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/ -name 'dump-type0*'); do chattr -i $i; rm $i; done\n```\n\nWith disabled auto boot the MacBook Pro will show the battery percentage for a\nbrief second as an image on the screen whenever you open the lid or plug in the\npower cord while the lid is open.\n\nTo re-enable auto boot again run:\n\n```\nchattr -i /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/AutoBoot-7c436110-ab2a-4bbb-a880-fe41995c9f82\nrm /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/AutoBoot-7c436110-ab2a-4bbb-a880-fe41995c9f82\n```\n\n### Links\n\n* Excellent collection providing a status of hardware support for the MacBook\n  Pro 2016 as well:\n  https://gist.github.com/roadrunner2/1289542a748d9a104e7baec6a92f9cd7\n"

Should work just fine from iOS 10 and beyond.\n\n[DEMO video on iPhone Xs simulator](CardPresentationController.mp4)\n\n### Modal presentation in iOS 13\n\niOS 13 changed the behavior of the ordinary `present(vc, ...) calls` - all modals now look like cards. *Thus you don\u2019t need this library on iOS 13.* I always recommend to use system stuff as much as possible thus this library will, by default, fallback to system look & behavior if you are on iOS 13. \n\nTo toggle this off and still use this library to present modal cards, set this at some point before presenting your first `UIViewController`:\n\n```\nCardPresentationController.useSystemPresentationOniOS13 = false\n```\n\nKeep in mind that visual display of multiple cards in this library is different from what iOS 13 does. (I don\u2019t intend to change this, it\u2019s not really worth it.)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Manually\n\nAdd the folder `CardPresentationController` into your project. It's only five files.\n\nIf you prefer to use dependency managers, see below. \nReleases are tagged with [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) in mind.\n\n### CocoaPods\n\n[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate Coordinator into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:\n\n```ruby\npod 'CardPresentationController', \t:git => 'https://github.com/radianttap/CardPresentationController.git'\n```\n\n### Setting up with Carthage\n\n[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.\n\nYou can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:\n\n```bash\n$ brew update\n$ brew install carthage\n```\n\nTo integrate CardPresentationController into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:\n\n```ogdl\ngithub \"radianttap/CardPresentationController\"\n```\n\n\n\n## Usage\n\nFrom anywhere you want to present some `UIViewController`, call\n\n```swift\nlet vc = ...\npresentCard(vc, animated: true)\n```\n\nYou dismiss it as any other modal:\n\n```swift\ndismiss(animated: true)\n```\n\nThis will present `vc` modally, flying-in from the bottom edge. Existing view will be kept shown as dimmed background card, on black background.\n\nYou can *present card from another card*; library will stack the cards nicely. Do use common sense as popups over popups don\u2019t make pleasant user experience.\n\n### Advanced behavior\n\nView of the `presenting` Controller will be (by default) 20% transparent to blend into the background a bit, thus looking dimmed.\n\nThat back \"card\" is also inset a bit from the edges.\n\n![](resources/presentedNC-top.png)\n\nIf the _presented_ VC is `UINavigationController` instance, nothing special happens. It\u2019s assumed that you will add `UIBarButtonItem` which will facilitate dismissal.\n\nIf it is not, then `CardPresentationController` will automatically add a button at the middle of the shown card. Tapping on that will dismiss the card.\n\n![](resources/presentedVC-top.png)\n\nAs you present card over card, back cards will be ever more transparent and horizontally inset. In most cases, this should look rather nice.\n\nLibrary also supports interactive dismissal \u2014 simply pan  from top to bottom and UI will obey you. You can pan up or down and the direction and position where you let go will determine will the card finish dismissing or return to presented state.\n\n### Status bar style\n\nCardPresentationController tries its best to enforce `.lightContent` status bar style. You can help it, by adding this into your UIVC subclass:\n\n```swift\noverride var preferredStatusBarStyle: UIStatusBarStyle {\n\treturn .lightContent\n}\n```\n\nIf you are presenting UINC, then my advice is to subclass it and override `preferredStatusBarStyle` property in the same way.\n\n## Requirements\n\n*Requires iOS 10*, since it uses [UIViewPropertyAnimator](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewpropertyanimator), [UISpringTimingParameters](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uispringtimingparameters) and a bunch of other modern UIKit animation APIs.\n\nOn iOS 11 it uses [maskedCorners](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer/2877488-maskedcorners) property to round just the top corners. On iOS 10.x it will fallback to rounding all corners.\n\n## How it works\n\nThe main object here is `CardTransitionManager`, which acts as  `UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate`. It is internally instantiated and assigned as property on UIVC which called `presentCard()` \u2013 that's _sourceController_ in the UIPresentationController parlance.\n\nThis instance of CTM is automatically removed on dismissal.\n\nCTM creates and manages the other two required objects:\n\n* `CardPresentationController`: manages additional views (like dismiss handle at the top of the card) and other aspects of the custom presentation\n* `CardAnimator`: which performs the animated transition\n\nIn case you missed it \u2014 *you don\u2019t deal with any of that*. It\u2019s all implementation detail, hidden inside these 3 classes. You never instantiate them directly.\n\nThe only object you can put to use, if you want to, is\u2026\n\n### CardConfiguration\n\nWhen calling `presentCard`, you can supply optional `CardConfiguration` instance. This is simple struct containing the following parameters:\n\n```swift\n///\tVertical inset from the top or already shown card\nvar verticalSpacing: CGFloat = 16\n\n///\tLeading and trailing inset for the existing (presenting) view \n/// when it's being pushed further back\nvar horizontalInset: CGFloat = 16\n\n///\tHeight of the \"empty\" area at the top of the card \n///\twhere dismiss handle glyph will be centered.\npublic var dismissAreaHeight: CGFloat = 16\n\n///\tCards have rounded corners, right?\nvar cornerRadius: CGFloat = 12\n\n///\tThe starting frame for the presented card.\nvar initialTransitionFrame: CGRect?\n\n///\tHow much to fade the back card.\nvar backFadeAlpha: CGFloat = 0.8\n\n///\tSet to false to disable interactive dismissal\nvar allowInteractiveDismissal = true\n```\n\nThere\u2019s a very handy `init` for it where you can supply any combination of these parameters.\n\nIf you don't supply config, then `CardConfiguration.shared` will be used, consisting of the default values shown above. \nYou can override this property early in app's lifecycle so adjust default look of the cards for the entire app (see AppDelegate.swift for an example).  \n\n### Advanced example\n\nThus if you want to control where the card originates \u2014 say if you want to mimic Apple Music's now-playing card \u2014 you can:\n\n```swift\nlet vc = ContentController.instantiate()\n\nlet f = container.convert(sender.bounds, to: view.window!)\nlet config = CardConfiguration(initialTransitionFrame: f)\n\npresentCard(vc, configuration: config, animated: true)\n```\n\nThe important bit here is setting `initialTransitionFrame` property to the frame *in the UIWindow coordinating space*, since transition happens in it.\n\n### Caveats\n\n`CardAnimator` animates layout of its own subviews \u2013 `from` and `to` views included in `transitionContext`. Behavior and layout of the internal subviews of both _presented_ and _presenting_/_source_ views is up to you *but* CardAnimator will try its best to animate them along.\n\nDepending on the complexity of your UI, in may be impossible to make the transition perfect. Usually in cases where UIKit applies its own private API magic related to status / navigation bars. \nSee `EmbeddedNCExample` where I have `UINavigationController` embedded inside ordinary `UIViewController`. This is very unusual UIVC stack which I would love to solve since I have project using just that.\n\n## LICENSE\n\n[MIT](LICENSE), as usual for all my stuff.\n\n\n## Give back\n\nIf you found this code useful, please consider [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/radianttap) or two. \u2615\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0b\n"

Currently it is [version 1.7.1](https://github.com/norio-nomura/EasySIMBL/releases/download/EasySIMBL-1.7.1/EasySIMBL-1.7.1.zip).\n\n2. Extract `EasySIMBL-1.6.zip` and move `EasySIMBL.app` into the Applications folder.\n\n3. Download and extract [BetterDictionary-v0.992.zip](https://github.com/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/releases/download/v0.992/BetterDictionary-v0.992.zip). It contains two files: `BetterDictionary.bundle` and `migrate-data`.\n\n4. Run EasySIMBL.\n\n5. Make sure \"Use SIMBL\" is checked.\n\n6. Drag and drop `BetterDictionary.bundle` into EasySIMBL:\n\n\t![Screenshot1](https://github.com/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/raw/master/Images/EasySIMBL.png)\n\n\n##### To migrate your data (from Mountain Lion)\n\n1. If you were already using BetterDictionary under Mountain Lion (or older versions) and wish to migrate your data, right-click on `migrate-data` and select 'Open'. In the next dialog, select 'Open' again.\n\n2. Dictionary.app should open now, with all your previous saved words intact. If it didn't work, simply copy `~/Library/Application Support/BetterDictionary/saved-words.plist` to `~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Dictionary/Data/Library/Application Support/BetterDictionary/saved-words.plist`.\n\n\n### OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion), 10.7 (Lion), and 10.6 (Snow Leopard)\n\nDownload [v0.98](https://github.com/downloads/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/BetterDictionary-0.98.zip) from the [Downloads](https://github.com/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/downloads) section. Then double-click on `BetterDictionary-0.98.zip` to unzip it.\n\nRight click on `BetterDictionary-0.98.app` and select 'Open'. In the next dialog, select 'Open' again. Then install the SIMBL plugin loader as instructed in the installer.\n\n\n\nUninstall\n---------\n\n### Removing BetterDictionary\n\n- **OS X 10.10 and 10.9**\n\n  Simply disable BetterDictionary in EasySIMBL.\n\n- **OS X 10.8, 10.7, and 10.6**\n\n  Open Terminal.app (from Applications -> Utilities). Type `open /Library/Application\\ Support/SIMBL/Plugins/` and press return.\n\n  Then Remove 'BetterDictionary.bundle' from this directory.\n\n### Removing SIMBL\n\nJust download, unzip and run [SIMBL Uninstaller](https://raw.github.com/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/master/Installers/SIMBL%20Uninstaller.zip) (86 KB). It will remove SIMBL and all its plugins from your system.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n------------------\n**\u2318+S**: Save word\n\n**\u2318+R**: Remove word\n\n**\u2318+\u21e7+D**: Display sidebar\n\n\n\n\nVersion History\n---------------\n\n### [v0.992](https://github.com/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/releases/tag/v0.992) (November 14th, 2014)\n\n- @tonyseek: [Added retina graphics](https://github.com/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/pull/4)\n\n\n### [v0.991](https://github.com/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/releases/tag/v0.991) (October 26th, 2014)\n\n- Updated for OS X 10.10 Yosemite\n\n- Automatically display the drawer when Dictionary.app is opened\n\n- Remove the occasionally-troublesome \"\u2318+\u21e7+R\" shortcut\n\n\n\n### [v0.99](https://github.com/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/releases/tag/v0.99) (November 15th, 2013)\n\n- Updated for OS X 10.9 Mavericks\n\n- On Mavericks, BetterDictionary now uses a drawer to display the sidebar\n\n- Dictionary.app is sandboxed under 10.9, so the saved word database is now at `~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Dictionary/Data/Library/Application Support/BetterDictionarysaved-words.plist`\n\n- v0.99 uses a simple [ruby script](https://github.com/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/blob/e94e6a0faa0ca228255db88bd55ab69ab8dbccad/Installers/BetterDictionary-0.99/migrate-data) to move saved words database from its previous location to sandbox container\n\n\n\n### [v0.98](https://github.com/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/releases/tag/v0.98) (October 10th, 2012)\n\n- Now works on Mountain Lion\n\n- Saved words database is now at `~/Library/Application Support/BetterDictionary/saved-words.plist`\n\n- Fixed a few bugs\n\n\n\n### [v0.97](https://github.com/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/releases/tag/v0.97) (July 28th, 2012)\n\n- Newer words are now shown on top\n\n\n\n### [v0.96](https://github.com/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/releases/tag/v0.96) (March 4th, 2012)\n\n- Lion compatibility\n\n\n\n### [v0.95](https://github.com/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/releases/tag/v0.95) (September 22nd, 2011)\n\n- Initial release\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n-----------\n### Yosemite\n\n![Screenshot1](https://github.com/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/raw/master/Images/BetterDictionary-Yosemite.png)\n\n\n### Mavericks\n\n![Screenshot1](https://github.com/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/raw/master/Images/BetterDictionary-Mavericks.png)\n\n\n### Mountain Lion\n\n![Screenshot1](https://github.com/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/raw/master/Images/BetterDictionary-MountainLion.png)\n\n\n### Lion\n\n![Screenshot1](https://github.com/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/raw/master/Images/BetterDictionary-Lion.png)\n\n\n### Snow Leopard\n\n![Screenshot2](https://github.com/pooriaazimi/BetterDictionary/raw/master/Images/BetterDictionary-SnowLeopard.png)\n"

  "readme_contents": "# The Neural Engine \u2014 what do we know about it?\n\nMost new iPhones and iPads have a **Neural Engine**, a special processor that makes machine learning models really fast, but not much is publicly known about how this processor actually works.\n\nThe Apple Neural Engine (or ANE) is a type of **NPU**, which stands for Neural Processing Unit. It's like a GPU, but instead of accelerating graphics an NPU accelerates neural network operations such as convolutions and matrix multiplies. \n\nThe ANE isn't the only NPU out there \u2014 many companies besides Apple are developing their own AI accelerator chips. Besides the Neural Engine, the most famous NPU is [Google's TPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_processing_unit) (or Tensor Processing Unit).\n\n## Why this document?\n\nWhen I was still providing ML consulting services for iOS, I would often get email from people who are confused why their model doesn't appear to be running on the Neural Engine, or **why it is so slow** when the ANE is supposed to be way faster than the GPU...\n\nIt turns out that **not every Core ML model can make full use of the ANE**. The reason why can be complicated, hence this document tries to answer the most common questions. \n\nThe ANE is great for making ML models run really fast on iPhones and iPads. A model that is optimized for the ANE will seriously outperform the CPU and GPU. But the ANE also has limitations. Unfortunately **Apple isn't giving third-party developers any guidance** on how to optimize their models to take advantage of the ANE. It's mostly a process of trial-and-error to figure out what works and what doesn't.\n\n> **Note:** Everything here was obtained by experimentation. I do not work at Apple and never have, so I am not privy to any implementation details of this chip. Some of this information is probably wrong. It's definitely incomplete. If you know something that isn't explained here, or if you find information that is wrong or missing, please [file an issue](https://github.com/hollance/neural-engine/issues) or [make a pull request](https://github.com/hollance/neural-engine/pulls). Thanks!\n\nI was originally planning to make this a [blog post](http://machinethink.net/blog) but decided to put it on GitHub to make it a community resource and so that other people could contribute to it too.

  "readme_contents": "# RC6502 Apple 1 Replica\n\nSince building and spending time with the excellent [RC2014](http://rc2014.co.uk) computer kit, I wanted to build another one from scratch while learning even more about them along the way. Combine that with the love of old machines I'll never be able to own, and the missing knowledge to actually do that I instead started looking for books on how things work on a more basic level.\n\nSeems someone, Tow Owad ofcourse, wrote a book on called \"Apple 1 Replica Creation, Back to the garage\" on how to build an Apple 1 computer from scratch and made it freely available on [http://www.applefritter.com/](http://www.applefritter.com/). Couldn't possibly find a more perfect match, so thank you for that Tom! Only thing missing was the PCBs, so with that in mind I set about designing them in KiCAD. Before long, the RC6502 Apple 1 Replica was born.\n\nI started designing each function as a separate module for ease of debugging, later all this was concentrated down into a computer on a single PCB. A so called Single Board Computer (SBC) to call my own, but with the ability to connect it up to a backplane of your choice (either my own, or you can use the RC2014 one) so that extra functionality can be plugged in and added as you please. The fun part is designing additions for it, so check out the various modules if there's something you'd like to add to it.\n\nI've been documenting the build process of the various components on my blog at [https://hvetebolle.blogspot.no/p/rc6502.html](https://hvetebolle.blogspot.no/p/rc6502.html), but be warned that it's in my native language (Norwegian) so this might not be anywhere close to readable for most people. For those of you relying on English as a language, and don't want to try out Google Translate, the essence of it is that it all amounts to a fully functional Apple 1 replica computer built with the cheapest parts possible!\n\n![RC6502 Computer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tebl/RC6502/master/Gallery/2017-06-02%2019.54.19.jpg)\n![RC6502 SBC Computer](https://github.com/tebl/RC6502/raw/master/RC6502%20Apple%201%20SBC/gallery/2017-07-09%2015.17.21.jpg)\n\n## Modules\nLike the RC2014 I've decided to keep things very modular with each card more or less doing one simple thing, easier to wrap ones head around as a beginner and a lot easier to understand when troubleshooting - also a lot cheaper to upgrade or replace since you don't actually need to replace the entire thing, just the specific board. With the conversion of the RC6502 computer to a SBC-version (Single Board Computer), you now have the option to build an all in one version on a single PCB - alternatively you can build the completely full-sized version as before if you want to! Most can be accomplished with the SBC version so to start things off, I recommend getting PCBs of the SBC ([order](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/RC6502_Apple_1_SBC__revision_D_.html?inviteid=88707)) as well as the backplane ([order](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/RC6502_Apple_1_Replica__Backplane_module_revision_A_.html?inviteid=88707)).\n\nThe full-sized system uses a 39-pin bus described in [`Bus.md`](Bus.md). The SBC supports the same bus, allowing you to use expansion cards with it; jumpers on the SBC allow you to disable any of the RAM, ROM, PIA and clock so that their functionality can be replaced by peripheral cards on the bus.\n\nIn order to build a single board computer (SBC) of RC6502 you'll need the following modules:\n- [RC6502 SBC](https://github.com/tebl/RC6502/tree/master/RC6502%20Apple%201%20SBC) ([order](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/RC6502_Apple_1_SBC__revision_H_.html?inviteid=88707))\n\nIn order to build the complete full-sized RC6502 you'll need the following modules:\n- [Backplane](https://github.com/tebl/RC6502-Apple-1-Replica/tree/master/RC6502%20Backplane) ([order](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/RC6502_Apple_1_Replica__Backplane_module_revision_A_.html?inviteid=88707))\n- [CPU](https://github.com/tebl/RC6502/tree/master/RC6502%20CPU)\n- [RAM](https://github.com/tebl/RC6502/tree/master/RC6502%20RAM)\n- [ROM](https://github.com/tebl/RC6502/tree/master/RC6502%20ROM)\n- [Reset Circuit](https://github.com/tebl/RC6502/tree/master/RC6502%20Reset%20Circuit)\n- [Serial IO](https://github.com/tebl/RC6502/tree/master/RC6502%20Serial%20IO)\n\nOptional modules:\n- [Backplane](https://github.com/tebl/RC6502-Apple-1-Replica/tree/master/RC6502%20Backplane) ([order](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/RC6502_Apple_1_Replica__Backplane_module_revision_A_.html?inviteid=88707))\n- [Prototyping module](https://github.com/tebl/RC6502-Apple-1-Replica/tree/master/RC6502%20Prototyping) ([order](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/RC6502_Apple_1_Replica__Module_prototyping_board_.html?inviteid=88707))\n- [Digital I/O and joystick](https://github.com/tebl/RC6502-Apple-1-Replica/tree/master/RC6502%20Joystick) ([order](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/RC6502_Apple_1_Replica__Joystick_module_revision_A_.html?inviteid=88707))\n- [RIOT 2600 (Atari 2600 RAM and digital I/O)](https://github.com/tebl/RC6502-Apple-1-Replica/tree/master/RC6502%20RIOT) ([order](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/RC6502_Apple_1_Replica__RIOT_2600_revision_A_.html?inviteid=88707))\n- [VDU](https://github.com/tebl/RC6502-Apple-1-Replica/tree/master/RC6502%20VDU) ([order](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/RC6502_Apple_1_Replica__VDU_module_revision_B_.html?inviteid=88707))\n- [VDU B/W Amplifier](https://github.com/tebl/RC6502-Apple-1-Replica/tree/master/RC6502%20VDU%20Amplifier) ([order](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/RC6502_Apple_1_Replica__VDU_B_W_Amplifier_revision_A_.html?inviteid=88707))\n- [VDU Color Amplifier](https://github.com/tebl/RC6502-Apple-1-Replica/tree/master/RC6502%20VDU%20Color%20Amplifier) ([order](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/RC6502_Apple_1_Replica__VDU_Color_Amplifier_revision_A_.html?inviteid=88707))\n\n\n\nIf you would like to have a copy of one or more modules, what you'll need to do is zip up the contents of the export directory for each module and give that to your favourite PCB fabrication plant. Personally I prefer to use [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/setinvite.aspx?inviteid=88707), each module is only 5$ each and new accounts even get the first one free! Please use the supplied link when signing up to help me support this project, I'll get a small discount on future orders and hopefully I can afford to keep developing new and exciting modules. Some of the modules also have an order-link, using this you won't have to deal with the rather daunting PCB fabrication order forms so you know it'll work on the first order attempt!\n"

Ideally, you should set this to be the same Group ID number as the user's primary group on the host system. If this variable is not set, it will default to '1000'.\n\n**force_gid**: If this variable is set it will allow the group to be created with a pre-existing group id. This may be handy if your group id clashes with a system group insude the docker container, however, if may have undesired permissions issues. Please use with caution.\n\n**TZ**: Sets the local timezone and is required to calculate timestamps. If this variable is not set, it will default to Coordinated Universal Time 'UTC'.\n\n**download_path**: This is the directory to which files will be downloaded from iCloud. If this variable is not set, it will default to \"/home/${user}/iCloud\".\n\n**synchronisation_interval**: This is the number of seconds between synchronisations. It can be set to the following periods: 21600 (6hrs), 43200 (12hrs), 86400 (24hrs), 129600 (36hrs), 172800 (48hrs) and 604800 (7 days). If this variable is not set to one of these values, it will default to 86400 seconds. Be careful if setting a short synchronisation period. Apple have a tendency to throttle connections that are hitting their server too often. I find that every 24hrs is fine. My phone will upload files to the cloud immediately, so if I lose my phone the photos I've taken that day will still be safe in the cloud, and the container will download those photos when it runs in the evening. Setting a value less than 12 hours will display a warning as Apple may throttle you.\n\n**synchronisation_delay**: This is the number of minutes to delay the first synchronisation. This is so that you can stagger the synchronisations of multiple containers. If this value is not set. It will default to 0. It has a maximum setting of 60.\n\n**notification_days**: When your cookie is nearing expiration, this is the number of days in advance it should notify you. This will default to 7 days if not specified so you will receive a single notification in the 7 days running up to cookie expiration.\n\n**authentication_type**: This is the type of authentication that is enabled on your iCloud account. Valid values are '2FA' if you have two factor authentication enabled or 'Web' if you do not. If 'Web' is specified, then cookie generation is not required. If this variable is not set, it will default to '2FA'.\n\n**directory_permissions**: This specifies the permissions to set on the directories in your download destination. If this variable is not set, it will default to 750.\n\n**file_permissions**: This specifies the permissions to set on the files in your download destination. If this variable is not set, it will default to 640.\n\n**folder_structure**: This specifies the folder structure to use in your download destination directory. If this variable is not set, it will set {:%Y/%m/%d} as the default. Use **none** to download to a flat file structure.\n\n**skip_check**: Set this to **True** skip the check for new files. The check can have issues with large libraries, please set to **True** if you have more than a few thousand photos. If this variable is not set, it will default to **False**.\n\n**download_notifications**: specifies whether notifications with a short summary should be sent for file downloads. If this variable is not set, it will default to **True**.\n\n**delete_notifications**: Specifies whether notifications with a short summary should be sent for file deletions. If this variable is not set, it will default to **True**.\n\n**delete_accompanying**: Tells the script to delete files which accompany the HEIC files that are downloaded. These are the JPG files which are created if you have HEIC to JPG conversion enabled. They are also the \\_HEVC.MOV files which make up part of a live photo. This feature deletes files from your disk. I'm not responsible for any data loss.\n\n**delete_empty_directories**: Tells the script to delete any empty directories it finds in the download path. It will only run if **folder_structure** isn't set to 'none'\n\n**set_exif_datetime**: Write the DateTimeOriginal exif tag from file creation date. If this variable is not set, it will default to **False**.\n\n**auto_delete**: Scans the \"Recently Deleted\" folder and deletes any files found in there. (If you restore the photo in iCloud, it will be downloaded again). If this variable is not set, it will default to **False**.\n\n**photo_size**: Image size to download. Can be set to **original**, **medium** or **thumb**. If this variable is not set, it will default to **original**.\n\n**skip_live_photos**: If this is set, it will skip downloading live photos. If this variable is not set, it will default to **False**.\n\n**live_photo_size**: Live photo file size to download. Can be set to **original**, **medium** or **thumb**. If skip_live_photos is set, this setting is redundant. If this variable is not set, it will default to **original**.\n\n**skip_videos**: If this is set, it will skip downloading videos. If this variable is not set, it will default to **False**.\n\n**recent_only**: Set this to an integer number to only download this many recently added photos. If this variable is not set, it will default to downloading all photos.\n\n**until_found**: Set this to an integer number to only download the most recently added photos, until *n* number of previously downloaded consecutive photos are found. If this variable is not set, it will default to downloading all photos.\n\n**photo_album**: Set this to the name of an album to only download photos from a single album. If this variable is not set, it will default to downloading all photos.\n\n## OPTIONAL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\n\n**command_line_options**: This is for additional command line options you want to pass to the icloudpd application. The list of options for icloudpd can be found [HERE](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/icloud_photos_downloader#usage).\n\n**convert_heic_to_jpeg**: Set this to True to convert downloaded HEIC files to JPEG, while also retaining the original.\n\n**jpeg_quality**: If HEIC to JPEG conversion is enabled, this variable will let you set the quality of the converted file by specifying a number from 0 (lowest quality) to 100 (highest quality) If convert_heic_to_jpeg is set, and this variable isn't, it will default to 90.\n\n**icloud_china**: Set this to True to use icloud.com.cm instead of icloud.com as the download source.\n\n**synology_photos_app_fix**: Set this to True to touch files after download and trigger the Synology Photos app to index any newly created files.\n\n**single_pass**: Set this to True to exit out after a single pass instead of looping as per the synchronisation_interval. If this option is used, it will automatically disable the download check. If using this variable, the restart policy of the container must be set to \"no\". If it is set to \"always\" then the container will instantly relaunch after the first run and you will hammer Apple's website.\n\n## NOTIFICATION CONFIGURATION VARIABLES\n\n**notification_type**: This specifies the method that is used to send notifications. These are the options available **Prowl**, **Pushover**, **Telegram**, **Webhook**, **openhab**, **Dingtalk**, **Discord**, **IYUU** and **WeCom**. When the two factor authentication cookie is within 7 days (default) of expiry, a notification will be sent upon synchronisation. No more than a single notification will be sent within a 24 hour period unless the container is restarted. This does not include the notification that is sent each time the container is started.\n\n**notification_title**: This allows you to change the title which is sent on the notifications. If this variable is not set, it will default to **boredazfcuk/iCloudPD**.\n\n**prowl_api_key**: Mandatory if notification_type set to 'Prowl'. This is the API key for your account as generated by the Prowl website.\n\n**pushover_user**: Mandatory if notification_type set to 'Pushover'. This is the Pushover user key associated with your account.\n\n**pushover_token**: Mandatory if notification_type set to 'Pushover'. This is the application API token. You will need to create an application by logging into your Pushover account and creating an application.\n\n**pushover_sound**: Mandatory if notification_type set to 'Pushover' this variable can be set to customise the sound of the notification. Values for this variable can be found here: https://pushover.net/api#sounds\n\n**telegram_token**: Mandatory if notification_type set to 'Telegram'. This is the token that was assigned to your account by The Botfather.\n\n**telegram_chat_id**: Mandatory if notification_type set to 'Telegram' then this is the chat_id for your Telegram bot. If the bot is a standard user that messages you, the chat ID will be a positive integer number. If the bot is a member of a group, and sends messages to the group, the chat ID will be prefixed with a hyphen '-' character.\n\n**webhook_server**: Mandatory if notification_type set to 'Webhook' or 'openhab' then this is the name of the server to connect to when sending webhook notifications.\n\n**webhook_port**: Mandatory if notification_type set to 'Webhook' or 'openhab' then this is the port number to use when connecting to the webhook server. If this is not set, it will default to 8123.\n\n**webhook_path**: Mandatory if notification_type set to 'Webhook' or 'openhab' then this is the path to use when connectiong to the webhook server. The path must start and end with a forward slash character. If this is not set, it will default to **/api/webhook/**. Openhab uses **\"/rest/items/<itemname>/\"**.\n\n**webhook_id**: Mandatory if notification_type set to 'Webhook' or 'openhab' then this is the Webhook ID to use. Openhab uses \"state\".\n\n**webhook_https**: If this is set to 'True' then the Webhook or openhab notification URL will use HTTPS, otherwise it will default to HTTP.\n\n**webhook_body**: Adapt to different services. Homeassistant uses \"data\" in the body of the webhook request, Discord uses \"content\", IFTTT uses \"value1\", etc.. Defaults to \"data\".\n\n**dingtalk_token**: Mandatory if notification_type set to 'Dingtalk' then this is the access token generated by the Dingtalk application. In the Dingtalk application, go to 'Security Settings', select 'Custom Keywords' and set to to the same value as **notification_title**.\n\n**discord_id**: This is the first half of the URL generated by Discord's webhook integration.  It will be all numbers.  Do not include any /\n\n**discord_token**: This is the second half of the URL generated by Discords webhook integration.  Do no include any /\n\n**iyuu_token**: Mandatory if notification_type set to 'IYUU'. This is the access token required to send messages.\n\n**wecom_id**: Mandatory if notification_type set to 'WeCom'. This is the CORPID associated with your account.\n\n**wecom_secret**: Mandatory if notification_type set to 'WeCom'. This is the CORPSECRET associated with your account.\n\n## VOLUME CONFIGURATION\n\nThis container requires a named volume mapped to /config. This is where is stores the authentication cookie. Without it, it will lose the cookie information each time the container is recreated.\nIt will download the photos to the \"/home/${user}/iCloud\" photos directory. You need to create a bind mount into the container at this point.\n\n## FAILSAFE FEATURE\n\nI have added a failsafe feature to this container so that it doesn't make any changes to the filesystem unless it can verify the volume it is writing to is mounted correctly. The container will look for a file called \"/home/${user}/iCloud/.mounted\" (please note the capitalisation of iCloud) in the download destination directory inside the container. If this file is not present, it will not download anything from iCloud. This way, if underlying disk/volume/whatever gets unmounted, sync will not occur and this prevents the script from filling up the root volume of the host. This file **MUST** be created manually and sync will not start without it.\n\n## CREATING A CONTAINER\n\nFirst off, create a dedicated network for your iCloudPD conter(s) as this overcomes some DNS and routing issues may occur if you use the legacy default network bridge that Docker creates. In this example, I've have told it to use the IP address subnet 192.168.115.1 - 192.168.115.254 and configured the gateway to be 192.168.115.254. You can use any subnet you like:\n\n```\ndocker network create \\\n   --driver=bridge \\\n   --subnet=192.168.115.0/24 \\\n   --gateway=192.168.115.254 \\\n   --opt com.docker.network.bridge.name=icloudpd_br0 \\\n   icloudpd_bridge\n```\nThen create the container, connecting it to the new icloudpd network bridge. It should look something like this:\n\n```\ndocker create \\\n   --name iCloudPD_boredazfcuk \\\n   --hostname icloudpd_boredazfcuk \\\n   --network icloudpd_bridge \\\n   --restart=always \\\n   --env user=boredazfcuk \\\n   --env user_id=1000 \\\n   --env group=admins \\\n   --env group_id=1010 \\\n   --env apple_id=notmy@email.com \\\n   --env apple_password=\"notmypasswordeither\" \\\n   --env authentication_type=2FA \\\n   --env notification_type=Telegram \\\n   --env telegram_token=123654 \\\n   --env telegram_chat_id=456321 \\\n   --env folder_structure={:%Y} \\\n   --env auto_delete=True \\\n   --env notification_days=14 \\\n   --env synchronisation_interval=21600 \\\n   --env TZ=Europe/London \\\n   --volume icloudpd_boredazfcuk_config:/config \\\n   --volume /home/boredazfcuk/iCloud:/home/boredazfcuk/iCloud \\\n   boredazfcuk/icloudpd\n```\n\n## CONFIGURING A PASSWORD\n\nOnce the container has been created, you should connect to it and run `/usr/local/bin/sync-icloud.sh --Initialise`. This will then take you through the process of adding your password to the container's keyring. It will also take you through generating a cookie that will allow the container to download the photos.\n\nIf you launch a container without initialising it first, you will receive this error message:\n```\nERROR    Keyring file /config/python_keyring/keyring_pass.cfg does not exist.\nINFO      - Please add the your password to the system keyring using the --Initialise script command line option.\nINFO      - Syntax: docker exec -it <container name> sync-icloud.sh --Initialise\nINFO      - Example: docker exec -it icloudpd sync-icloud.sh --Initialise\nINFO     Restarting in 5 minutes...\n```\n\nAs per the error, the container needs to be initialised by using the --Initialise command line option. With the first container still running, connect to it and launch the initialisation process by running the following at the terminal prompt (assuming the container name is 'icloudpd'):\n```\ndocker exec -it icloudpd sync-icloud.sh --Initialise\n```\n\nYou will then be asked to log in to icloud.com, with your current Apple ID and password, and will be prompted to enter a two factor authentication code which will be sent via SMS. Once that is confirmed, the password will be added to the keyring.\n\nIf you do not have an authentication cookie, and you have two factor authentication enabled on your account, you will be taken to the cookie generation process immediately after.\n\n## TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION\n\nIf your Apple ID account has two factor authentication enabled, you will see that the container waits for a two factor authentication cookie to be created:\n```\nERROR    Cookie does not exist.\"\nINFO      - Please create your cookie using the --Initialise script command line option.\"\nINFO      - Syntax: docker exec -it <container name> sync-icloud.sh --Initialise\"\nINFO      - Example: docker exec -it icloudpd sync-icloud.sh --Initialise\"\nINFO     Restarting in 5 minutes...\"\n```\n\nWithout this cookie, synchronisation cannot be started.\n\nAs per the error, the container needs to be initialised by using the --Initialise command line option. With the first container still running, connect to it and launch the initialisation process by running the following at the terminal prompt (assuming the container name is 'icloudpd'):\n```\ndocker exec -it icloudpd sync-icloud.sh --Initialise\n```\n\nAfter that, the script will log into the icloud.com website and save the 2FA cookie. Your iDevice will ask you if you want to allow or deny the login. When you allow the login, you will be give a 6-digit approval code. Enter the approval code when prompted.\n\nThe process should look similar to this:\n\n```\n2020-08-06 16:45:58 INFO     ***** boredazfcuk/icloudpd container for icloud_photo_downloader started *****\n2020-08-06 16:45:58 INFO     Alpine Linux v3.12\n2020-08-06 16:45:58 INFO     Interactive session: True\n2020-08-06 16:45:58 INFO     Local user: user:1000\n2020-08-06 16:45:58 INFO     Local group: group:1000\n2020-08-06 16:45:58 INFO     LAN IP Address: 192.168.20.1\n2020-08-06 16:45:58 INFO     Apple ID: email@address.com\n2020-08-06 16:45:58 INFO     Authentication Type: 2FA\n2020-08-06 16:45:58 INFO     Cookie path: /config/emailaddresscom\n2020-08-06 16:45:58 INFO     Cookie expiry notification period: 7\n2020-08-06 16:45:58 INFO     Download destination directory: /home/user/iCloud\n2020-08-06 16:45:58 INFO     Folder structure: {:%Y}\n2020-08-06 16:45:58 INFO     Directory permissions: 750\n2020-08-06 16:45:58 INFO     File permissions: 640\n2020-08-06 16:45:58 INFO     Synchronisation interval: 43200\n2020-08-06 16:45:58 INFO     Time zone: Europe/London\n2020-08-06 16:45:58 INFO     Additional command line options: --auto-delete --set-exif-datetime\n2020-08-06 16:45:58 INFO     Correct owner on config directory, if required\n2020-08-06 16:45:58 INFO     Correct group on config directory, if required\n2020-08-06 16:45:58 INFO     Adding password to keyring...\nEnter iCloud password for email@address.com:\nSave password in keyring?

Sync should now be successful.\n```\n\nThis will then place a two factor authentication cookie into the /config folder of the container. This cookie will expire after three months. After it has expired, you will need to re-initialise the container again.\n\nAfter this, the container should start downloading your photos.\n\nDockerfile has a health check which will change the status of the container to 'unhealthy' if the cookie is due to expire within a set number of days (notification_days) and also if the download fails. \n\n## COMMAND LINE OPTIONS\n\nThere are currently a number of command line options available to use with the sync-icloud.sh script. These are:\n\n**--ConvertAllHEICs**\nThis command line option will check for HEIC files that do not have an accompanying JPEG file. If it finds a HEIC that does not have an accompaying JPEG file, it will create it. This can be used to add JPEGs for previously downloaded libraries. The easiest way to run this is to connect to the running container and executing the script.\nTo run the script inside the currently running container, issue this command (assuming the container name is 'icloudpd'):\n```\ndocker exec -it icloudpd sync-icloud.sh --ConvertAllHEICs\n```\n\n**--ForceConvertAllHEICs**\nThis command line is the same as the above option but it will overwrite any JPEG files that are already there. This will result in data loss if the downloaded JPEG files have been edited. For this reason, there is a 2 minute delay before this option runs. This gives you time to stop the container, or cancel the script, before it runs. This option is required as the heif-tools conversion utility had a bug that over-rotates the JPEG files. This means the orientation does not match the HEIC file. The heif-tools package has now been replaced by the ImageMagick package which doesn't have this problem. This command line option can be used to re-convert all your HEIC files to JPEG, overwriting the incorrectly oriented files with correctly oriented ones.\n\nTo run the script inside the currently running container, issue this command (assuming the container name is 'icloudpd'):\n```\ndocker exec -it icloudpd sync-icloud.sh --ForceConvertAllHEICs\n```\n\n**--ForceConvertAllmntHEICs**\nThis command line is the same as the above option but it will overwrite any JPEG files that it finds in the /mnt subdirectory. This will result in data loss if the downloaded JPEG files have been edited. For this reason, there is a 2 minute delay before this option runs. This gives you time to stop the container, or cancel the script, before it runs. This option is required as the heif-tools conversion utility had a bug that over-rotates the JPEG files. This means the orientation does not match the HEIC file. The heif-tools package has now been replaced by the ImageMagick package which doesn't have this problem. This command line option can be used to re-convert all your HEIC files to JPEG, overwriting the incorrectly oriented files with correctly oriented ones. This option can be used to correct JPG files that have been archived and removed from your iCloud photostream. Just mount the target directory (or directories) into the /mnt subdirectoy and the script with this command.\n\nTo run the script inside the currently running container, issue this command (assuming the container name is 'icloudpd'):\n```\ndocker exec -it icloudpd sync-icloud.sh --ForceConvertAllmntHEICs\n```\n\n**--CorrectJPEGTimestamps**\nThis command line option will correct the timestamps of JPEG files that do not match their accompanying HEIC files. Due to an omission, previous versions of my script never set the time stamp. This command line option will correct this issue.\n\nTo run the script inside the currently running container, issue this command (assuming the container name is 'icloudpd'):\n```\ndocker exec -it icloudpd sync-icloud.sh --CorrectJPEGTimestamps\n```\n\n**--Initialise**\nThis command line option will allow you to add your password to the system keyring. It will also force the creation of a new two-factor authentication cookie.\nTo run the script inside the currently running container, issue this command (assuming the container name is 'icloudpd'):\n```\ndocker exec -it icloudpd sync-icloud.sh --Initialise\n```\n\n## HEALTH CHECK\n\nI have built in a health check for this container. If the script detects a download error the container will be marked as unhealthy. You can then configure this container: https://hub.docker.com/r/willfarrell/autoheal/ to monitor iCloudPD and restart the unhealthy container. Please note, if your 2FA cookie expires, the container will be marked as unhealthy, and will be restarted by the authoheal container every five minutes or so... This can lead to a lot of notifications if it happens while you're asleep!\n\nBitcoin: 1E8kUsm3qouXdVYvLMjLbw7rXNmN2jZesL\nLitecoin: LfmogjcqJXHnvqGLTYri5M8BofqqXQttk4\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Sign in with Apple strategy for Passport\n\n[![ci](https://github.com/nicokaiser/passport-apple/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nicokaiser/passport-apple/actions/workflows/ci.yml)\n[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40nicokaiser%2Fpassport-apple.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nicokaiser/passport-apple)\n\n[Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) strategy for authenticating with [Sign in with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/).\n\n## Install\n\n    $ npm install @nicokaiser/passport-apple\n\n## Usage\n\n### Create a Service\n\nBefore using this module, you must register a service with Apple. You need an Apple Developer Account for this.\n\n- Register a new **App ID**, e.g. `com.example.test`, and enable the \"Sign in with Apple\" capability.\n- Register a new **Services ID**, e.g. `com.example.account`. This is the `clientID` for the module configuration. Configure \"Sign in with Apple\" for this service and set the **Return URLs**.\n- You might need to verify the ownership of the Domain by following the instructions.\n- Register a new **Key**, enable \"Sign in with Apple\" for this key and download it. Its ID is the `keyID`.\n\n### Configure Strategy\n\nThe Sign in with Apple authentication strategy authenticates users using an Apple ID and OAuth 2.0 tokens. The strategy options are supplied in the step above. The strategy also requires a `verify` callback, which receives an access token and profile, and calls `cb` providing a user.\n\n```js\npassport.use(new AppleStrategy({\n    clientID: 'com.example.account', // Services ID\n    teamID: '1234567890', // Team ID of your Apple Developer Account\n    keyID: 'ABCDEFGHIJ', // Key ID, received from https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list\n    key: fs.readFileSync(path.join('path', 'to', 'AuthKey_XYZ1234567.p8')), // Private key, downloaded from https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list\n    scope: ['name', 'email'],\n    callbackURL: 'https://example.com/auth/apple/callback'\n  },\n  (accessToken, refreshToken, profile, cb) => {\n    User.findOrCreate({ exampleId: profile.id }, (err, user) => {\n      return cb(err, user);\n    });\n  }\n));\n```\n\nIf `passReqToCallback` is set to `true`, `req` will be passed as the first argument to the verify callback:\n\n```js\npassport.use(new AppleStrategy({\n    clientID: 'com.example.account', // Services ID\n    ...\n    passReqToCallback: true\n  },\n  (req, accessToken, refreshToken, profile, cb) => {\n    ...\n  }\n));\n```\n\n### Authenticate Requests\n\nUse `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `'apple'` strategy, to authenticate requests. The authorization code is passed via the `code` POST parameter, so your endpoint callback needs to support HTTPS POST and provide the `req.body` property.\n\nFor example, as route middleware in an [Express](http://expressjs.com/) application, using `express.urlencoded` to provide `req.body`:\n\n```js\napp.get('/auth/apple',\n  passport.authenticate('apple'));\n\napp.post('/auth/apple/callback',\n  express.urlencoded(),\n  passport.authenticate('apple', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),\n  (req, res) => {\n    // Successful authentication, redirect home.\n    res.redirect('/');\n  });\n```\n\nYou can find a complete example at [examples/server.js](examples/server.js).\n\n\n### Nonce Verification\nTo supply and verify a nonce to prevent a login session from being replayed, use the verifyNonce option when creating the strategy:\n```\nconst generatedNonces = new NodeCache();\n\npassport.use(new AppleStrategy({\n    ...\n    verifyNonce: function(req, nonce, callback){\n        if(generatedNonces.take(nonce)){\n            callback(null, true);\n        }else{\n            callback(new Error('invalid nonce'), false);\n        }\n    },\n  },\n  ...\n);\n```\nAnd supply a nonce value in the options to each authenticate call:\n```\napp.post('/auth/apple/callback',\n  express.urlencoded(),\n  function(req, res, next){\n      const nonce = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex');\n      generatedNonces.set(nonce, 1);\n      passport.authenticate('apple', { failureRedirect: '/login', nonce: nonce })(req, res, next);\n  },\n  (req, res) => {\n    // Successful authentication, redirect home.\n    res.redirect('/');\n  });\n```\n\nFor multi-server applications the nonces must be shared between all servers, for example by storing them in a shared cache or database.\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Which fields are provided in the user profile?\n\nApple currently returns a User ID that is tied to you Team ID. That means, the same Apple ID will result in the same User ID returned for authentication requests done with your Team ID. Other Teams will get a different ID for this User.\n\nAlso, if the User wants to, their name and email address is returned:\n\n```js\n{ id, name: { firstName, lastName }, email } = profile;\n```\n\n*Note that the `name` and `email` properties are only returned on the first login the user*.\n\n#### Why not just use [passport-oauth2](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-oauth2/)?\n\nThe login flow for Sign in with Apple is similar to OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect, but there are quite some differences. The OpenID Foundation published a document about this: [How Sign In with Apple differs from OpenID Connect](https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/src/default/How-Sign-in-with-Apple-differs-from-OpenID-Connect.md).\n\nNamely, instead of a static `client_secret`, a JWT is used, however in a non-standard way. Also, user data is submitted alongside the authentication code via HTTP POST (and only if the \"form_post\" response mode is used!).\n\nApple is still working on the interfaces, as Sign in with Apple is still in beta, so it may be OIDC compliant at some point in the future.\n\n#### How does this module differ from [passport-apple](https://github.com/ananay/passport-apple/)?\n\n[passport-apple](https://github.com/ananay/passport-apple/) uses passport-oauth2 and replaces its client secret methods. This works, however it does not support retrieving user data (like name and email). In order to properly support this, you would need to basically re-write a slimmed down version of passport-oauth2, which basically is what this module provides.\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under [MIT](./LICENSE).\n"

It indicates the max volume size for that user.\n\nNow you have a docker instance running `netatalk`.\n\n\n### Step 3\u00a0- Enable Auto Discovery\n\nAvahi daemon is commonly used to help your computers to find the services provided by a server.\n\nAvahi isn't built into this Docker image because, due to Docker's networking limitations, Avahi can't spread it's messages to announce the services.\n\n**If you want to enable this feature, you can install Avahi daemon on your host** following these steps (Ubuntu version):\n\n* Install `avahi-daemon`: run `sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon avahi-utils`\n* Copy the file from `avahi/nsswitch.conf` to `/etc/nsswitch.conf`\n* Copy the service description file from `avahi/afpd.service` to `/etc/avahi/services/afpd.service`\n* Restart Avahi's daemon: `sudo /etc/init.d/avahi-daemon restart`\n\n\n### Step 4\u00a0- Configure Your Firewall\n\nMake sure\n\n* your server can receive traffic on port `548` and `636` (e.g., `ufw allow 548`, (`636` respectively)).\n\n* your Mac allows outgoing connections (Little Snitch?)\n\n\n\n### Step 5\u00a0- Start Using It\n\nTo start using it, follow these steps:\n\n* If you use Avahi, open **Finder**, go to **Shared** and connect to your server with your new username and password.\n\n* Alternatively (or if you don't use Avahi) from **Finder** press **CMD-K** and type `afp://your-server` where `your-server` can be your server's name or IP address (e.g., `afp://my-server` or `afp://192.168.0.5`).\n\n* Go to **System Preferences**, and open **Time Machine** settings.\n\n* Open **Add or Remove Backup Disk...**\n\n* Select your new volume.\n\n\nIn the example below, the Docker instance is running on server `central`. For `USERNAME` the account `Backup` along with a `PASSWORD` was created. Once connected, the account `Backup` is available in Time Machine settings:\n![alt text](docs/overview.jpg \"Getting Started\")\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Configure using environment variables\n\nYou can configure the container using environment variables (for example, if you use a `docker-compose` environment).\n\nThere are these environment variables:\n\n* **AFP_LOGIN**: User name\n* **AFP_PASSWORD**: User password\n* **AFP_NAME**: Name of the volume\n* **AFP_SIZE_LIMIT**: Size in MB of the volume (optional)\n* **PUID**: For UID\n* **PGID**: For GID\n\nUsing these variables, the container will create a user at boot time (only one per container) and **the data will be stored directly in the volume `/timemachine`, without subfolders**.\n\nTo find your `PUID` and `GUID` use `id user` as below:\n```\n    $ id <dockeruser>\n       uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockeruser)  groups=1000(dockergroup)\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n\n#### I got Docker running, my firewall is configured, but I still don't find the service in Time Machine.\n\nMake sure you actually mount the server volume (see Step 5) before trying to find it in Time Machine settingss.\n\n\n### My container restarted and I can't login\n\nThe user accounts are ephemeral and you'll have to run `Step 2` again to re-create the accounts.\nAlternativey, you can script the account creation and upload a custom entrypoint with the details:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\n\n# Repeat for all your accounts\nadd-account USERNAME PASSWORD VOL_NAME VOL_ROOT [VOL_SIZE_MB]\nadd-account USERNAME PASSWORD VOL_NAME VOL_ROOT [VOL_SIZE_MB]\n/usr/bin/supervisord -c /etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf\n```\n\nSave the above file as `entrypoint.sh` and make sure it is marked as executable (`chmod +x entrypoint.sh`). Then invoke `docker run` as:\n\n```\n$ docker run -h timemachine --name timemachine --restart=unless-stopped -d -v /external_volume:/timemachine -it -p 548:548 -p 636:636 -v entrypoint.sh:/entrypoint.sh odarriba/timemachine-rpi\n```\n\n#### I am still having trouble ...\n\n* The idea of using avahi-daemon installed in the bare metal server is to avoid having to execute the container with --net=host, which a potentially insecure flag. But, as the last option to check things out, it should be fine. You just should know what you are enabling.\n\n* A Time Machine network disk is just a disk image in an AFP volume that supports the correct level of encryption. So to be recognised by the TimeMachine daemon, you should mount the unit manually for the first time, configure TimeMachine on your computer, and then the OS will do that for you automatically.\n\n\n\n#### Why do I need to install Avahi on your host and not in the container?\n\nBecause if you don't do it this way, the discovery message won't be able to reach your computers.\n\n\n\n## Contributors\n\n* \u00d3scar de Arriba (odarriba@gmail.com)\n* Daniel I\u00f1igo (demil133@gmail.com)\n* Josef Friedrich ([@Josef-Friedrich](https://github.com/Josef-Friedrich))\n"

  "readme_contents": "# react-native-apple-authentication\nThis npm module is used for authentication using **Apple id** in **React Native** apps.\nApple sign-in only works with IOS platform and the setup guide considers the same.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo install the module, run the following command in your project directory:\n\n`$ npm install --save react-native-apple-authentication`\n\n### Automatic Installation\n\nFrom react-native version 0.60 we don't need to link any third party module separately but if you found it has not been included with your project then you can run the following:\n\n`$ react-native link react-native-apple-authentication`\n\n### Manual Installation\n\n#### iOS\n\n1. In XCode, in the project navigator, right click `Libraries` \u279c `Add Files to [your project's name]`\n2. Go to `node_modules` \u279c `react-native-apple-authentication` and add `AppleSignIn.xcodeproj`\n3. In XCode, in the project navigator, select your project. Add `libAppleSignIn.a` to your project's `Build Phases` \u279c `Link Binary With Libraries`\n4. Run your project (`Cmd+R`)\n\n## Configure Project\n\n## iOS\n\n1. **Sign in with Apple is supportable from `XCode 11` and `iOS 13`. Although you can install XCode 11 on Mac Mojave 10.14.14 and later.** \n2. Before running the project set development team in the `Signing & Capabilities` tab so Xcode can create a provisioning profile that. If you've already created project and provisioning profile then ignore this.\n3. **Add the `Sign In with Apple capability` in your project.** This will add an entitlement that lets your app use Sign In with Apple.\n4. When you try to sign in, you'll see an `AUTH_ALERT_SIGN_UP_NOT_COMPLETED` error message. Signing in won't work in your application until you create a key with Sign in with Apple enabled in your developer account.\n5. To enable Sign In with Apple in your developer account you need to create an `Auth Key` with Sign In with Apple. on your developer account.\n6. If you don\u2019t see the Sign in with Apple listed when you create a key the you're probably in an Enterprise team. Just creating the key should sufficent for now, you will only need to download it when you want to support Sign in with Apple from somewhere other than your application.\n7. If you're creating a key for grouped app then create a key for your primary App ID in order to implement Sign In with Apple. This key will also be used for any App IDs grouped with the primary. The user will see your primary app's icon at sign in and in their Apple ID account settings.\n8.

  "readme_contents": "# Apple Store Reserve Monitor\n\n## Supports all iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch\n#### Including iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11, iPad 11 Pro, iPad Air 2019\n#### Now also check appointment availability due to COVID-19 store entry restrictions\n\n- A script to monitor status of the iPhone/iPad/Watch availability in a given country.\n- Configuration file to filter by country, device type, models number, carriers, and stores.\n- Makes an audio announcement if there is a change in the stock for given configuration.\n\n### Configuration (Config.json)\n\nThe configuration file has the following variables:\n\n1. _country_code_ - ISO code for country (2 character) _(required)_\n2. _device_family_ - Filter the device by the apple device family name. _(required)_\n\n| Device Family Names |\n|---------------------|\n| iphone11pro |\n| iphone11 |\n| iphonexr |\n| iphone8 |\n| ipadpro_11 |\n| ipadair2019 |\n| ipad_10_2_2019 |\n| ipadmini2019 |\n\n3. _zip_code_ - ZIP code to search for (e.g. 90210) _(required)_\n4. _models_ - List the models you are interested about, it does a partial match so country specific information can be stripped (`MQ8J2LL/A`, `MQ8J2`). The default value is all available models.\n5. _carriers_ - Carriers you are interested in. US carriers - `TMOBILE/US`, `SPRINT/US`, `ATT/US`, `VERIZON/US`, `UNLOCKED/US`. If you are outside US do not put this in.\n6. _stores_ - ID of the stores you are interested in (you will have to run the script once to get the store ID), default value is all the stores in that region (also available [here](https://gist.github.com/iF2007/ff127f7722af91c47c0cb44d6c1e961d).)\n7. appointment_stores -  ID of the stores you want to look for appointments in. This is optional, if you do not put this configuration the app will not look for appointments. In COVID-19 times appointments have become a hassle to get (at least in Berlin).\n\n**To get store's ID, model number, and carrier names you will have to run the script once.**\n\n### Apple Watch\n\nTo monitor Apple Watch skip family name parameter and just enter the particular model number. An example configuration would be.\n\n```\n{\n  \"country_code\": \"us\",\n  \"zip_code\": \"90210\",\n  \"models\": [\"MU642LL/A\"],\n  \"stores\": [\"R462\"],\n  \"appointment_stores\": [\"R462\"],\n}\n```\n\nYou can get the correct model number for the device you are looking for from the URL such as\n`https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch/silver-aluminum-white-sport-band?preSelect=false&product=MU642LL/A&step=detail#`\nthe `product` value is the model number, here are a few examples:\n\n- Apple Watch Space Gray Aluminum Case with Sport Band (MWT52LL/A)\n- Apple Watch Gold Stainless Steel Case with Sport Loop (MWQN2LL/A)\n\nThanks to [@rovingrob](https://twitter.com/rovingrob) for pointing this out!\n\n### How To Run:\n\n- Ensure you have Python 3.6 and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n- Execute `./store_checker.py` to run once.\n- Execute `./monitor.py` to keep running it every 30 seconds.\n\n![image](listing.png)\n![image](appointment_slot.png)\n\n### Model Numbers (US)\n\n- These are some model numbers but others can be found easily at third party sellers.\n- Keep in mind these are country specific but you can truncate the information to skip the country information.\n- To get the exact model code for your country go to your country equivalent of https://www.apple.com/de/shop/product-locator-meta?family=iphone12mini and get the `partNumber`.\n\n| Family Name | Product Name                                    |

There are plenty things in CIS that can be done more readily with configuration profiles, some things that are ... contradictory and others that may not even be relevant to your needs. I'm not convinced 100% compliance is the way to go and allow people to be able to work.\n\nNot everything in CIS is implemented here. This is partly due to some standards being implemented by profiles and others being out of date and effectively deprecated.\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Apple Pie\n\nApple pie is a HTTP Server implementation in [Zig](https://ziglang.org). The initial goal is to offer full support for http versions 1.0 and 1.1 with 2.0 and further planned at a later stage. With Apple Pie I'd like to offer a library that contains all features you'd expect from a server, while still remaining performant. Rather than hiding complexity, I want to expose its functionality so users can replace and/or expand upon to fit their needs.\n\n## Roadmap\n- HTTP 1.1 spec (fully) implemented\n\n## Features\n- Crossplatform support\n- Extensive routing (see the [router](examples/router.zig) example) built in\n- Allows for both async and blocking I/O using Zig's std event loop\n\n## Example\nA very basic implementation would be as follow:\n\n```zig\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst http = @import(\"apple_pie\");\n\n// use evented mode for event loop support\npub const io_mode = .evented;\n\n// optional root constant to define max stack buffer size per request\npub const buffer_size: usize = 4096;\n// optional root constant to define max header size per request\npub const request_buffer_size: usize = 4096;\n\n/// Context variable, accessible by all handlers, allowing to access data objects\n/// without requiring them to be global. Thread-safety must be handled by the user.\nconst Context = struct {\n    data: []const u8,\n};\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    defer _ = gpa.deinit();\n\t\n    const my_context: Context = .{ .data = \"Hello, world!\" };\n\t\n    try http.listenAndServe(\n        gpa.allocator(),\n        try std.net.Address.parseIp(\"127.0.0.1\", 8080),\n        my_context,\n        index,\n    );\n}\n\nfn index(ctx: Context, response: *http.Response, request: http.Request) !void {\n    _ = request;\n    try response.writer().print(\"{s}\", .{ctx.data});\n}\n```\n\nMore examples can be found in the [examples](examples) folder.\n\n## Building\n\nApple Pie is being developed on Zig's master branch and tries to keep up-to-date with its latest development.\n\nTo build Apple Pie a simple\n`zig build` will suffice.\n\nTo build any of the examples, use the following:\n```\nzig build example -Dexample=<example_name>\n```\nit will appear in `zig-out/bin/example_name`\n"

You can read more about the PiSight [on Medium](https://pisight.camera).\n\n![PiSight photo front view](photo-front.jpg)\n\n## Hardware\n\n| Part | Info | Price (2020) |\n| :- | :- | -: |\n| [Apple iSight](http://www.minimallyminimal.com/blog/apple-isight) | Available new and used on eBay | [$15 to 150](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Apple+iSight) |\n| [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/) | The [W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) version adds Wifi, which makes working with it easier and opens it up to more applications | [$5](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2885) or [$10](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3400) |\n| [Raspberry Pi Camera V2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/) | Supports 1080p@30 or 720p@60, at a 62\u00b0 horizontal field of view | [$29.95](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3099) |\n| M2.6 screws | 4 of M2.6 x 0.45 mm Thread, 6 mm long | [$9.26 for 25](https://www.mcmaster.com/91290A073/) |\n| M2 screws | 2 of M2 x 0.4 mm Thread, 4 mm long | [$13.28 for 100](https://www.mcmaster.com/91290A011/) |\n| O-ring | Covers the gap around the lens | [$6.16 for 50](https://www.mcmaster.com/9262K562/) |\n| Raspberry Pi Zero camera cable | A few options, but the 15 cm long narrow ones seem to work best | [$3.49](https://www.waveshare.com/raspberry-pi-zero-v1.3-camera-cable.htm) |\n| Micro-USB cable | Many options, just need to fit the iSight adapter | [$8.99](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Powerline-Micro-USB-Smartphones/dp/B012VZT5IO/) |\n| 3D-printed frame | Use [`PiSight.stl`](PiSight.stl) or [`PiSight.step`](PiSight.step), dimensions in mm, cost varies significantly depending on material quality | [$50 to $200](https://www.fictiv.com) |\n\n![PiSight rendered side view](render-side.jpg)\n\n## Software\n\nThe PiSight camera implements the [UVC standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_video_device_class) via the [Gadget API](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/usb/gadget.html), which turns the Raspberry Pi and camera into a plug-and-play USB webcam. I used the instructions in [David Hunt](https://github.com/climberhunt)'s [blog post](http://www.davidhunt.ie/raspberry-pi-zero-with-pi-camera-as-usb-webcam/), with a few modifications in [my own fork](https://github.com/maxbbraun/uvc-gadget) of `uvc-gadget`.\n\nI consolidated these steps into a [setup script](setup.sh), so you simply need to install [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/), enable the camera and serial interfaces via `raspi-config`, and then run:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/maxbbraun/pisight\ncd pisight\nsudo ./setup.sh\n```\n\n**Update:** There is now an alternative setup option thanks to the [`showmewebcam`](https://github.com/showmewebcam/showmewebcam) project, which is better maintained and provides pre-built optimized images (provided you don't mind seeing _Piwebcam_ instead of _PiSight_ in settings).\n\n![PiSight in Zoom settings](zoom-settings.gif)\n"

  "repo": "lifepillar/CSVKeychain",
  "language": "AppleScript",
  "readme_contents": "# CSVKeychain AppleScript script\n\nThis repo contains scripts to export all your password items and secure notes\nfrom Apple's Keychain.app into plain text files in CSV format, merge such files\nand import them back into a keychain.\n\nNo trick or reverse engineering is used: exporting is performed by Apple's\n`security` tool, using macOS's assistive support to streamline the process.\n\nThe current master should work in (High) Sierra.\nEarlier versions of macOS/OS X are not supported.\n\n\n## How to use\n\nTo import/export password items, open the AppleScript script in Script Editor.\nThe script may be run from source.\n\nBefore running the script, go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy >\nPrivacy > Accessibility, and allow Script Editor to control your computer.\nThis step is\nrequired to avoid SecurityAgent to prompt you with a dialog for each item you\nwant to export. It basically allows AppleScript to press the Allow button in\nsuch dialogs for you.\n\nYou may also build the script into an application if you want. In this case, you\nmust grant the app control of your computer in the same way.\n\nThe script always asks for the password to unlock your keychain (you recognise\nthe dialog by the Script Editor icon). Since that dialog is not very\nsecure, it is recommended that you change your keychain's password in\nKeychain.app before exporting your keychain, and restore the original password\nafterwards. You may also be asked to unlock your keychain by SecurityAgent\n(which you do by providing your keychain's password). So, you may have to enter\nyour keychain's password once or twice. After that, SecurityAgent will keep\nprompting for a password for each exported item, but the script should fill it\nout for you automatically, so no further action from you will be required.\n\nThe script makes a backup of the keychain before importing or exporting data.\nBackups are timestamped and saved into the same folder containing the keychain.\nIn any case, it is a good idea to keep a separate backup, just in case.\n\nWhen importing items into a keychain, *matching items already present in the\nkeychain are overwritten if their timestamps are older than the timestamps of\nthe items being imported.* If there are items without timestamps in the CSV\nfile, the script will ask the user what to do with them. Note that this will be\nasked once and the choice applied to all the items being imported.\n\nAlso note that *all* new or updated items are assigned the current time as their\nnew timestamps. There is no possibility to retain the original timestamps from\nthe CSV file.\n\nFinally, access control lists are not exported.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you get this error:\n\n```\nThis script will be terminated prematurely because the following error has\noccurred:\n\nsecurity: SecKeychainUnlock [...]: The user name or\npassphrase you entered is not correct. (Error number: 51)\n```\n\nopen Keychain.app and lock your keychain. Then, run the script again.\n\n## Merging files\n\nA Ruby script is provided to merge two CSV files containing password data into\none. See `./merge_csv.rb --help` for the details.\n\n\n## Is it possible to export the Local Items (aka iCloud) keychain?\n\n**Note: the workaround described in this section does not appear to work in\nmacOS High Sierra or later. You may have better luck with\n[Get passwords from iCloud keychain directly](https://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/comment/455708/#Comment_455708)\nand [Get passwords from Safari](https://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/comment/455305/#Comment_455305).**\n\nNot directly. The Local Items keychain, located at\n`~/Library/Keychains/<UUID>/<name>.db`, is a SQLite database containing\nobfuscated data, so its format is different from the format of a standard\nkeychain. As far as I can see, `security` cannot dump such keychains, and I do\nnot know of any tool that would do that.\n\nYou may proceed as follows:\n\n1. In Keychain.app, create a new keychain: File > New Keychain\u2026\n2. Select the Local Items keychain in the sidebar, then select all the items\n   (or the ones you want to export) and copy them by choosing Edit > Copy.\n3. Select the keychain created at step one and choose Edit > Paste.\n\nSuch process is painful, though, because Keychain.app will keep asking for\na password for each item. You may automate such process with [a bit of\nscripting](https://gist.github.com/rmondello/b933231b1fcc83a7db0b). For your\nconvenience, the script that allows you to fill in the password prompts for you\nis reported below:\n\n```applescript\ntell application \"System Events\"\n\trepeat while exists (processes where name is \"SecurityAgent\")\n\t\ttell process \"SecurityAgent\"\n\t\t\tset frontmost to true\n\t\t\ttry\n\t\t\t\tkeystroke \"PUT YOUR KEYCHAIN'S PASSWORD HERE\"\n\t\t\t\tdelay 0.1\n\t\t\t\tkeystroke return\n\t\t\t\tdelay 0.1\n\t\t\ton error\n\t\t\t\t-- do nothing to skip the error\n\t\t\tend try\n\t\tend tell\n\t\tdelay 0.5\n\tend repeat\nend tell\n```\n\nYou may run this directly from Script Editor. A similar approach can be used to\nexport `/Library/Keychains/System.keychain`.\n\n**Note:** Keychain.app won't allow you to paste some items (most likely,\nautomatically created by the system, not yours). In such case, the snippet above\nwill produce a script error and Keychain.app will show an error dialog, too.\nDismiss both and run the script again. Repeat every time you get an error.\n\n\n## Migrate passwords and notes into KeePass\n\nIf you want to import the CSV file generated by CSVKeychain into a KeePass\n2 database and you are on macOS, you may need to convert it to XML first. For\nsuch purpose, add a category column to the CSV file using the included\n`add_category.rb` script. Then, use my\n[csv2keepassxml](https://github.com/lifepillar/csv2keepassxml) to generate\na KeePass 2 XML file.\n\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2011\u20132018, Lifepillar\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

  "readme_contents": "# CoreMediaIO-DAL-Example\n\nModernized and extended version of Apple's CoreMediaIO sample code.\n\n### Before you jump right in\n\nApple announced the **deprecation of CMIO DAL plugins** at WWDC 2022, sunsetting them definitely in the next major release after macOS 13 (that is, in macOS 14). As a replacement, [Camera Extensions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremediaio/creating_a_camera_extension_with_core_media_i_o) have been introduced in macOS 12.3 which are now the preferred way to develop camera plugins. If you are about to start development, do yourself a favor: drop support for anything below macOS 12.3 and **don't waste your time with DAL plugins**.\n\nIf you are still here, read on.\n\n### Description\n\nThis repository started off as a fork of the official [CoreMediaIO sample code](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/samplecode/CoreMediaIO/Introduction/Intro.html) by Apple. Unfortunately, the original code didn't age well since it was last updated in 2012 so here you can find the necessary changes to make it compile on modern systems.\n\n### Virtual camera support\n\nThe original sample was mainly focused around camera plugins backed by real hardware which may be of little interest to anyone who is not a camera manufacturer. So eventually the code was extended with virtual camera support, i.e. DAL plugins that appear and can act like video sources but have no accompanying hardware. These cameras may draw their frames from whatever source they please, including but not limited to baked-in still images, content generated on-the-fly by the plugin itself, and relayed frames originating from a user-space companion application. (Note that the present code only implements reading from a static framestore.)\n\n### Known issues\n\n- the kext is not being maintained and is most probably dysfunctional\n- IPC between the plugin and assistant is still built around the obsolete bootstrap server, this should be replaced by XPC\n- and many more, see the [Issues tab](https://github.com/lvsti/CoreMediaIO-DAL-Example/issues) (and help reporting them if you come across one)\n\n### Requirements to build\n\nXcode 10.1+\n\nNote: the sample YUV files in the [KernelExtension](https://github.com/lvsti/CoreMediaIO-DAL-Example/tree/master/Sources/Extras/CoreMediaIO/DeviceAbstractionLayer/Devices/Sample/KernelExtension) folder have been removed from the repo because the increased traffic continuously exhausted my LFS quota. From now on, please refer to the official [CoreMediaIO sample code](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/samplecode/CoreMediaIO/Introduction/Intro.html) bundle which also contains these files.\n\n### Contributing\n\nThe goal of this project is to maintain an up-to-date and relevant sample code for those who have just made first contact with the CoreMediaIO DAL world. Contributions along these lines are warmly welcome. Improvements, however, that are introducing a new feature or would steer the project away from its general/educational purpose would probably best be placed in a different fork.\n\n### License\n\nMIT\n"

  "readme_contents": "# Xamarin Apple API docs\n\nThis repository contains the source of the Xamarin API documentation for native functions in Apple operating systems:\n\n- iOS\n- macOS\n- tvOS\n- watchOS\n\nAn example URL to start browsing is http://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/uikit\n\n## Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).\nFor more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.\n\n## Style guidelines\n\nAll Xamarin Apple API docs are written in the [indicative mood](https://grammarist.com/grammar/english-moods/). For instance, instead of saying \"You call this function to foo the bar,\" the docs should be \"The developer calls this function to foo the bar.\" The agents we refer to are typically \"the developer,\" \"the method\" (or \"the object\"), \"the framework,\" and \"the system\" (meaning the underlying operating system or hardware services). The indicative mood often takes a little time to get used to, but it helps avoid ambiguity about responsibilities and cuts down on the temptation to use passive voice. \n\nAPI docs are divided between `summary` and `remarks` elements. Summaries are displayed in IntelliSense and should be quite short (perhaps around 140 characters, certainly fewer than 250). If there is a numeric value with an underlying unit-of-measure, include the unit in the summary (e.g., \"The angle, in radians,\" or \"the distance, in meters\"). \n\nSummaries may contain tags, but should not wrap their content in another tag:\n\n- Right: `<summary>Foos the <paramref name=\"bar\"/>.</summary>` \n- Wrong: `<summary><para>Foos the <paramref name=\"bar\"/>.</para></summary>`\n\n## Scripts included in the repository\n\n- **make all**: run xmllint with the bundled monodoc-ecma.xsl to\n   verify the syntax of the documentation in the repository\n\n## Using DocWriter\n\nUse github.com/xamarin/DocWriter to author documentation.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIn case macdoc blows up when trying to load the documentation or you can't compile the docs or similar check for:\n\n- **busted index.xml**: run the above `missing` script which will\n    give you the entry in the xml that are not present in the\n    filesystem\n\n- **parse error**: run `make all` to check for syntax errors in the\n    documentation files\n\n## Using MacDoc?\n\nRun macdoc by passing the absolute path to the en/ directory\n(i.e. where the index.xml file is) preprended with the character '+'.\n\n    ./macdoc.app/Contents/MacOS/macdoc '+/path/to/ios-api-docs/en/'\n\nYou need a recent macdoc. You can compile it yourself by cloning\nhttps://github.com/mono/monomac and running the build process\nthere. Macdoc is under the samples directory.\n\nThis repository is also submoduled by XamarinVS to fetch the baseline docs from where MSXML docs are generated and later merged with iOS docs on the user's machine.\n\n## Viewing history?\n\nOn January 22, 2018, commits 542f219f and ce6f06729 renamed the directories from, e.g., `en/MonoTouch.UIKit` to `en/UIKit`. In almost all cases `git log {type.xml}` will track back only to these commits. To track past those commits, use:\n\n    git log --follow --find-copies-harder --find-renames=40 {type.xml}\n    \nLowering the `find-renames` threshold to around 40 seems to work   in almost all cases. You can try lower thresholds, although at some point you could presumably start triggering incorrect matches. \n\n## Legal Notices\n\nMicrosoft and any contributors grant you a license to the Microsoft documentation and other content\nin this repository under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode),\nsee the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file, and grant you a license to any code in the repository under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), see the\n[LICENSE-CODE](LICENSE-CODE) file.\n\nMicrosoft, Windows, Microsoft Azure and/or other Microsoft products and services referenced in the documentation\nmay be either trademarks or registered trademarks of Microsoft in the United States and/or other countries.\nThe licenses for this project do not grant you rights to use any Microsoft names, logos, or trademarks.\nMicrosoft's general trademark guidelines can be found at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=254653.\n\nPrivacy information can be found at https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/\n\nMicrosoft and any contributors reserve all others rights, whether under their respective copyrights, patents,\nor trademarks, whether by implication, estoppel or otherwise.\n"

This\nconsists of opening an email, clicking a link and entering the Apple ID\ncredentials in a form.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- I created this script to use Mail and Safari which exist on every Mac.\n\n- All the verification emails must be on the same mailbox. You can do this\nby creating all the Apple IDs using email aliases to one master email.\n\n### Instructions\n\n- Edit the script variables at the very top of the script to reflect your \npassword and domain.\n\nNOTE: If you're using the same password for all Apple IDs then just make the\nchanges and leave the script unchanged. I used a different password for \neach ID (I was told by an Apple rep that I had to) with the following\nformat: `iPad-secretword-01`\nYou can easily replicate that type of format by modifying the commented out\nline in the script:\nset `aidPassword to a & \"-\" & secretWord & \"-\" & b`\n\n- Open Safari and Mail.\n\n- Run script.\n\n\n### Known Bugs\n\nNo checking on whether Mail is open or not. If it is not the script will fail.\n\n\n### Download\n\nThe files are downloadable from GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/ntoqiakt/Apple-ID-AppleScript Feel free to fork\nand improve.\n\nBrought to you by [ntoqiakt][]\n\n  [ntoqiakt]: https://github.com/ntoqiakt\n"

Iterate over nested, or multidimensional, hashes.\n\n\n## The Holiday Suppliers\n\n### Instructions\n\nYou have a bunch of decorations for various holidays organized by season.\n\n```ruby\nholiday_supplies = {\n  :winter => {\n    :christmas => [\"Lights\", \"Wreath\"],\n    :new_years => [\"Party Hats\"]\n  },\n  :summer => {\n    :fourth_of_july => [\"Fireworks\", \"BBQ\"]\n  },\n  :fall => {\n    :thanksgiving => [\"Turkey\"]\n  },\n  :spring => {\n    :memorial_day => [\"BBQ\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWrite your methods in `lib/holiday.rb`; use the comments in each method as guides.\n\n* Write a method that returns the second supply for the Fourth of July. For eg:\n\n```ruby\ndef second_supply_for_fourth_of_july(holiday_supplies)\n  holiday_supplies[:summer][:fourth_of_july][1]\nend\n```\n\n* Write a method that adds a supply to both Winter holidays.\n\n* Write a method that adds a supply to Memorial Day.\n\n* Write a method that adds a new holiday and its associated supplies to any season.\n\n* Write a method to collect all Winter supplies from all the winter holidays. For eg:\n\n```bash\nwinter_supplies(holiday_supplies) #=> [\"Lights\", \"Wreath\", etc]\n```\n\n* Write a method that uses a loop to list out all the supplies you have for each holiday and the season. Use string manipulation to get your output to match what the test is expecting.\n\n* Here are a few helpful tips:\n  * Our hash keys are symbols. We need to convert them into strings. Use the `.to_s` method on a symbol to convert it into a string.\n  * Look closely at the output string that the test is expecting. You'll notice that it expects holiday names, like \"New Years\", to have both words capitalized. Ruby has a `.capitalize` method that you can call on a string. **But, note:**\n    * `.capitalize` returns the capitalized string but *doesn't change* the original string. So, when you call on that same string in the future, it *isn't capitalized!* You can capitalize a string for now and evermore by using the bang operator (`!`).\n    * You'll need to capitalize *both words* in a given holiday's name. If you call `\"new years\".capitalize!`, it will return `\"New years\"`. In order to capitalize *both* words, you'll need to `.split` the string into an array and iterate over that array to `.capitalize!` each word in it. Then, you'll need to `.join` the array back into a string.\n    * If you're unfamiliar with the methods mentioned above, look them up in the Ruby documentation.\n\nExample of expected output:\n\n```\nWinter:\n  Christmas: Lights, Wreath\n  New Years: Party Hats\n```\n\n* Write a method to collect all holidays with \"BBQ\" in the supply array. The method should behave as seen below:\n\n```bash\nholidays_with_bbqs(holiday_supplies)\n#=> [:fourth_of_july, :memorial_day]\n```\n\n**Reminder:** This is a challenging lab, so remember to use Pry, Google, and the Flatiron School community to help you get the tests passing.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [StackOverflow: Accessing Elements of Nested Hashes in Ruby](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5544858/accessing-elements-of-nested-hashes-in-ruby)\n- [honeybadger - Advanced Ruby Hash Techniques](http://blog.honeybadger.io/advanced-ruby-hash-techniques/)\n\n\n\n"

Security and Privacy of Apple's Crowd-Sourced Bluetooth Location Tracking System** to the [PoPETs Artifact Review](https://petsymposium.org/artifacts.php) process.\nOur submission includes (1) the experimental evaluation of the offline finding system in Section 7 of our paper and (2) the PoC implementation of the attack presented in Section 10.\nThe [_OpenHaystack_](README.md) framework in this repository goes beyond the contributions made in our PoPETs paper and, therefore, is not part of our submission. However, we invite the reviewers to test this code as well.\n\n## Location Report Accuracy (Section 7)\n\nWe provide the raw data and evaluation scripts used for the experimental evaluation of the offline finding system in Section 7 of our paper.\nThe code should be self-explanatory and generates Figures 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 11 and Tables 5, 6, and 7 of our paper.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Web browser to run the code via the online [Binder](https://mybinder.org) service  \n  _Alternative:_ Python environment to run the code locally\n\n### Instructions\n\nWe implement all code in a single Jupyter notebook provided in an external repository. Please refer to the included README file for detailed instructions: https://github.com/seemoo-lab/offline-finding-evaluation.\n\n## Unauthorized Access of Location History (Section 10)\n\nWe provide a proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation of the attack presented in Section 10 of our paper.\nThe PoC consists of two parts: (1) the application that reads the private keys from the victim's device and (2) the application that downloads and decrypts the corresponding location reports.\n\n### Requirements\n\nSince our PoC targets a fixed vulnerability in macOS 10.15.7, the reviewer requires a device that is vulnerable to the attack. A second Apple device is required to trigger the generation and synchronization of keys. In summary, the reviewer needs\n\n- a macOS device running macOS 10.15.6 or earlier (provided as a VM) and\n- a second iOS (>=13.0) or macOS (>=10.15.0) device.\n\nBoth devices need to be logged into the same iCloud account, and both participate in Apple's _Find My network_ (see [Apple's official documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210400)).\n\n### Instructions\n\nThe PoC consists of two applications that are needed: _OFReadKeys_ and _OFFetchReports_. _OFReadKeys_ is the malicious application installed by a user. The user needs to install this application manually. _OFFetchReports_ must run on the attacker's Mac. We provide the schematic overview from our paper below.\nFor testing, both applications can also be installed on the same machine, which we describe in the following.\n\n![Attack flow](Resources/CVE-2020-9986.png)\n\n#### Preparation: disable SIP and AMFI\n\nThe attacker machine needs to have system integrity protection (SIP) and AMFI **disabled**. This allows _OFFetchReports_ to access Apple account tokens necessary to authenticate at iCloud to download location reports.\n\n1. Boot macOS into recovery mode (hold \u2318+R during boot).\n2. Open Terminal (from the _Utilities_ drop-down menu).\n3. Execute `csrutil disable` in Terminal to disable SIP.\n4. Execute `nvram boot-args=\"amfi_get_out_of_my_way=0x1\"` to disable AMFI.\n5. Reboot macOS normally.\n\n#### Reading keys\n\n6. Open the Xcode project in [CVE-2020-9986/OFReadKeys](CVE-2020-9986/OFReadKeys).\n7. Run the _OFReadKeys_ target.\n8. Export the advertisement keys using the single button to a file.\n\n#### Fetching reports\n\n9. Run the _Run OFFetchReports_ target.\n10. Import the exported key file via drag and drop.\n11. Watch _OFFetchReports_ downloading and decrypting the location reports.\n"
